# Constraints on inflation from scale-invariant gravity

## Abstract:

### Background and context

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that the Universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion -- inflation -- very early on in its history.  This conclusion is based on careful observations made in the late Universe, combined with physical cosmology and assuming textbook general relativity to correctly describe the gravitational interaction. However, general relativity alone does not provide an inflationary mechanism and (with the possible, and actually quite compelling exception of the Higgs sector) neither does the Standard Model of particle physics.

An interesting possibility is that general relativity descends at low energies from a more fundamental scale-invariant theory, which describes physics at higher energies below the Planck scale. Scale invariance is an attractive constraint from the perspective of model-building, and the additional dynamics that are present in the resulting models are thought to provide a viable inflaton field. So far, the self-interaction potential for such a field has been obtained analytically, but the observable signatures for inflation have not been thoroughly deduced from it.

### Project objectives

In this project we will investigate the inflationary signatures of scale-invariant gravity using some robust numerical techniques. Depending on the candidate's preferences after the initial exercises are completed, there are two directions to explore:

1. We may focus on the theoretical development of the model, such as the addition of extra so-called "compensator" fields, and the resulting implications for the potential. It is also possible to explore whether unusual features are present in the potential which could give rise to non-standard power spectra (e.g. inflection points leading to ultra-slow-roll inflation).

2. We may go beyond the boilerplate comparison with summary statistics of the Planck data, as usually seen in the [hep-th] literature, and perform an [astro-ph.CO]-style Bayesian analysis to constrain the theory. This route will require the candidate to use high-performance computing techniques and learn about Bayesian inference in precision cosmology.
