However, it is interesting to ask what would be the functional form of f(R) in the case when the value of r is different from the one predicted by the Starobinsky model. In this paper, we show how to determine the form of f(R), once the slow-roll parameters are known with some accuracy. The striking result is that, for given values of the scalar spectral index nS and r, the effective Lagrangian has the form f(R)=Rζ, where ζ=2-ε and |ε|≪ 1.

    abstract = {We study ‘hilltop’ inﬂation, in which inﬂation takes place near a maximum of the potential. Viewed as a model of inﬂation after the observable Universe leaves the horizon (observable inﬂation) hilltop inﬂation is rather generic. If the potential steepens monotonically, observable hilltop inﬂation gives a tiny tensor fraction (r {\textless}∼ 0.002). The usual F - and D-term models may easily be transmuted to hilltop models by Plancksuppressed terms, making them more natural. The only commonly-considered model of observable inﬂation which is deﬁnitely not hilltop is tree-level hybrid inﬂation. Viewed instead as an initial condition, we explain that hilltop inﬂation is more generic than seems to have been previously recognized, adding thereby to the credibility of the idea that eternal inﬂation provides the pre-inﬂationary initial condition.},

    abstract = {This paper reviews the dynamics of a single isotropic and homogeneous scalar field φ(t) in the context of cosmological models. A non-standard approach to the solution of the Einstein–Klein–Gordon equations is described which uses the scalar field as the evolution parameter for cosmic dynamics. General conclusions about the qualitative behaviour of the solutions can be drawn, and examples of how to obtain explicit solutions for some cosmological models of interest are given. For arbitrary potentials, analytical results can be obtained from the slow-roll approximation by using a series expansion for the Hubble parameter H[φ], from which a quantitative estimate for the number of e-folds of expansion is obtained. This approach is illustrated with the examples of quadratic potentials and hilltop models, with special consideration of Higgs-type potentials. The GUT-scale is shown to come out of such a model quite naturally. Finally, it is discussed how to find scalar potentials giving rise to a predetermined scalar-field behaviour and the associated evolution of the scale factor.},

    abstract = {A non-minimally coupled scalar field can have, in principle, a negative effective Planck mass squared which depends on the scalar field. Surprisingly, an isotropic and homogeneous cosmological universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field is perfectly smooth as the rolling scalar field causes the effective Planck mass to change sign and pass through zero. However, we show that any small deviations from homogeneity diverge as the effective Planck mass vanishes, with catastrophic consequences for the cosmology. The physical origin of the divergence is due to the presence of non-zero scalar anisotropic stress from the non-minimally coupled scalar field. Thus, while the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology appears surprisingly sensible when the effective Planck mass vanishes, inhomogeneities tell a different story.},
