However, it is interesting to ask what would be the functional form of f(R) in the case when the value of r is different from the one predicted by the Starobinsky model. In this paper, we show how to determine the form of f(R), once the slow-roll parameters are known with some accuracy. The striking result is that, for given values of the scalar spectral index nS and r, the effective Lagrangian has the form f(R)=Rζ, where ζ=2-ε and |ε|≪ 1.

    abstract = {We study ‘hilltop’ inﬂation, in which inﬂation takes place near a maximum of the potential. Viewed as a model of inﬂation after the observable Universe leaves the horizon (observable inﬂation) hilltop inﬂation is rather generic. If the potential steepens monotonically, observable hilltop inﬂation gives a tiny tensor fraction (r {\textless}∼ 0.002). The usual F - and D-term models may easily be transmuted to hilltop models by Plancksuppressed terms, making them more natural. The only commonly-considered model of observable inﬂation which is deﬁnitely not hilltop is tree-level hybrid inﬂation. Viewed instead as an initial condition, we explain that hilltop inﬂation is more generic than seems to have been previously recognized, adding thereby to the credibility of the idea that eternal inﬂation provides the pre-inﬂationary initial condition.},

    abstract = {This paper reviews the dynamics of a single isotropic and homogeneous scalar field φ(t) in the context of cosmological models. A non-standard approach to the solution of the Einstein–Klein–Gordon equations is described which uses the scalar field as the evolution parameter for cosmic dynamics. General conclusions about the qualitative behaviour of the solutions can be drawn, and examples of how to obtain explicit solutions for some cosmological models of interest are given. For arbitrary potentials, analytical results can be obtained from the slow-roll approximation by using a series expansion for the Hubble parameter H[φ], from which a quantitative estimate for the number of e-folds of expansion is obtained. This approach is illustrated with the examples of quadratic potentials and hilltop models, with special consideration of Higgs-type potentials. The GUT-scale is shown to come out of such a model quite naturally. Finally, it is discussed how to find scalar potentials giving rise to a predetermined scalar-field behaviour and the associated evolution of the scale factor.},

    abstract = {A non-minimally coupled scalar field can have, in principle, a negative effective Planck mass squared which depends on the scalar field. Surprisingly, an isotropic and homogeneous cosmological universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field is perfectly smooth as the rolling scalar field causes the effective Planck mass to change sign and pass through zero. However, we show that any small deviations from homogeneity diverge as the effective Planck mass vanishes, with catastrophic consequences for the cosmology. The physical origin of the divergence is due to the presence of non-zero scalar anisotropic stress from the non-minimally coupled scalar field. Thus, while the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology appears surprisingly sensible when the effective Planck mass vanishes, inhomogeneities tell a different story.},

    abstract = {The current ﬂow of high-accuracy astrophysical data, among which are the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, oﬀers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the inﬂationary theory. This is however a challenging project given the size of the inﬂationary landscape which contains hundreds of diﬀerent scenarios. Given that there is currently no observational evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature perturbations or any other non-minimal extension of the inﬂationary paradigm, a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models ﬁrst, namely the slow-roll single-ﬁeld models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and eﬃcient strategies. It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of approximate model-independent methods while a more ambitious alternative is to study the inﬂationary scenarios one by one. We have developed the publicly available runtime library ASPIC1 to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating-consistent observable predictions within this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an evolutive code which presently supports 118 diﬀerent models. In this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in a systematic manner, thereby constituting the ﬁrst Encyclopædia Inﬂationaris.},

    abstract = {We introduce a simple string model of inflation, in which the inflaton field can take trans-Planckian values while driving a period of slow-roll inflation. This leads naturally to a realisation of large field inflation, inasmuch as the inflationary epoch is well described by the single-field scalar potential V = V0(3−4e−φ̂/(3)1/2). Remarkably, for a broad class of vacua all adjustable parameters enter only through the overall coefficient V0, and in particular do not enter into the slow-roll parameters. Consequently these are determined purely by the number of e -foldings, Ne, and so are not independent: ε ≃ 3⁄2η2. This implies similar relations among observables like the primordial scalar-to-tensor amplitude, r, and the scalar spectral tilt, ns: r ≃ 6(ns−1)2. Ne is itself more model-dependent since it depends partly on the post-inflationary reheat history. In a simple reheating scenario a reheating temperature of Trh ≃ 109 GeV gives Ne ≃ 58, corresponding to ns ≃ 0.970 and r ≃ 0.005, within reach of future observations. The model is an example of a class that arises naturally in the context of type IIB string compactifications with large-volume moduli stabilisation, and takes advantage of the generic existence there of Kähler moduli whose dominant appearance in the scalar potential arises from string loop corrections to the Kähler potential. The inflaton field is a combination of Kähler moduli of a K3-fibered Calabi-Yau manifold. We believe there are likely to be a great number of models in this class—“high-fibre models”—in which the inflaton starts off far enough up the fibre to produce observably large primordial gravity waves.},

    abstract = {We present a novel inflationary scenario in theories with low scale (TeV) quantum gravity, in which the standard model particles are localized on the branes whereas gravity propagates in the bulk of large extra dimensions. This inflationary scenario is natural in the brane world picture. In the lowest energy state, a number of branes sit on top of each other (or at an orientifold plane), so the vacuum energy cancels out. In the cosmological setting, some of the branes “start out” relatively displaced in the extra dimensions and the resulting vacuum energy triggers the exponential growth of the 3 non-compact dimensions. The number of e-foldings can be very large due to the very weak brane-brane interaction at large distances. In the effective four-dimensional field theory, the brane motion is described by a slowly rolling scalar field with an extremely flat plateau potential. When branes approach each other to a critical distance, the potential becomes steep and inflation ends rapidly. Then the branes “collide” and oscillate about the equilibrium point, releasing energy mostly into radiation on the branes. In this scenario, it is even possible for the electroweak Higgs field to be the inflaton.},

In particular we show how the Einstein equations or energy-momentum conservation can be used to obtain simple evolution equations at linear order, and discuss extensions to non-linear order. We present evolution equations for systems with multiple interacting fluids and scalar fields, identifying adiabatic and entropy perturbations. As an application we consider the origin of primordial curvature and isocurvature perturbations from field perturbations during inflation in the very early universe.},

    abstract = {We report on the implications for cosmic inflation of the 2018 Release of the Planck CMB anisotropy measurements. The results are fully consistent with the two previous Planck cosmological releases, but have smaller uncertainties thanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization at low and high multipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the spectral index of scalar perturbations to be \$n\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}=0.9649{\textbackslash}pm 0.0042\$ at 68\% CL and show no evidence for a scale dependence of \$n\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}.\$ Spatial flatness is confirmed at a precision of 0.4\% at 95\% CL with the combination with BAO data. The Planck 95\% CL upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, \$r\_\{0.002\}{\textless}0.10\$, is further tightened by combining with the BICEP2/Keck Array BK15 data to obtain \$r\_\{0.002\}{\textless}0.056\$. In the framework of single-field inflationary models with Einstein gravity, these results imply that: (a) slow-roll models with a concave potential, \$V" ({\textbackslash}phi) {\textless} 0,\$ are increasingly favoured by the data; and (b) two different methods for reconstructing the inflaton potential find no evidence for dynamics beyond slow roll. Non-parametric reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum consistently confirm a pure power law. A complementary analysis also finds no evidence for theoretically motivated parameterized features in the Planck power spectrum, a result further strengthened for certain oscillatory models by a new combined analysis that includes Planck bispectrum data. The new Planck polarization data provide a stringent test of the adiabaticity of the initial conditions. The polarization data also provide improved constraints on inflationary models that predict a small statistically anisotropic quadrupolar modulation of the primordial fluctuations. However, the polarization data do not confirm physical models for a scale-dependent dipolar modulation.},

It is shown that if the density fluctuations at this epoch are proportional to ��−�� (where �� is the number of particles in a disturbance), then �� must exactly, or very closely, equal the value 23 in order that such fluctuations develop into protogalaxies. This result is independent of the value of the threshold epoch, and of the equation of state for the very early universe. Arguments of a speculative nature are then presented which indicate that the threshold epoch occurs at the Planck density. It is also proposed that the initial conditions of galaxy formation are metric fluctuations at the threshold epoch of classical cosmology. The evidence in favor of this theory is (i) the density fluctuation obeys the �� =23 rule, and (ii) the spin fluctuation gives an eventual angular momentum of the order ��43⁢ℏ, in reasonable agrement with that of the Galaxy.},

    abstract = {The general qualitative behavior of linear, first-order density perturbations in a Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmological model with radiation and matter has been known for some time in the various limiting situations. An exact quantitative calculation which traces the entire history of the density fluctuations is lacking because the usual approximations of a very short photon mean free path before plasma recombination, and a very long mean free path after, are inadequate. We present here results of the direct integration of the collision equation of the photon distribution function, which enable us to treat in detail the complicated regime of plasma recombination. Starting from an assumed initial power spectrum well before recombination, we obtain a final spectrum of density perturbations after recombination. The calculations are carried out for several general-relativity models and one scalar-tensor model. One can identify two characteristic masses in the final power spectrum: one is the mass within the Hubble radius ct at recombination, and the other results from the linear dissipation of the perturbations prior to recombination. Conceivably the first of these numbers is associated with the great rich clusters of galaxies, the second with the large galaxies. We compute also the expected residual irregularity in the radiation from the primeval fireball. If we assume that (1) the rich clusters formed from an initially adiabatic perturbation and (2) the fireball radiation has not been seriously perturbed after the epoch of recombination of the primeval plasma, then with an angular resolution of t minute of arc the rms fluctuation in antenna temperature should be at least Δ = 0.00015.},

    abstract = {In recent years, the use of conformal transformation techniques has become widespread in the literature on gravitational theories alternative to general relativity, on cosmology, and on nonminimally coupled scalar fields. Typically, the transformation to the Einstein frame is generated by a fundamental scalar field already present in the theory. In this context, the problem of which conformal frame is the physical one has to be dealt with and, in the general case, it has been clarified only recently; the formulation of a theory in the ``new'' conformal frame leads to departures from canonical Einstein gravity. In this article, we review the literature on conformal transformations in classical gravitational theories and in cosmology, seen both as purely mathematical tools and as maps with physically relevant aspects. It appears particularly urgent to refer the analysis of experimental tests of Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor theories of gravity, as well as the predictions of cosmological inflationary scenarios, to the physical conformal frame, in order to have a meaningful comparison with the observations.},

    abstract = {We argue that in a nonlinear gravity theory (the Lagrangian being an arbitrary function of the curvature scalar R), which according to well-known results is dynamically equivalent to a self-gravitating scalar field in general relativity, the true physical variables are exactly those which describe the equivalent general-relativistic model (these variables are known as the Einstein frame). Whenever such variables cannot be defined, there are strong indications that the original theory is unphysical, in the sense that Minkowski space is unstable due to the existence of negative-energy solutions close to it. To this aim we first clarify the global net of relationships between the nonlinear gravity theories, scalar-tensor theories, and general relativity, showing that in a sense these are ‘‘canonically conjugated’’ to each other. We stress that the isomorphisms are in most cases local; in the regions where these are defined, we explicitly show how to map, in the presence of matter, the Jordan frame to the Einstein one and vice versa. We study energetics for asymptotically flat solutions for those Lagrangians which admit conformal rescaling to the Einstein frame in the vicinity of flat space. This is based on the second-order dynamics obtained, without changing the metric, by the use of a Helmholtz Lagrangian. We prove for a large class of these Lagrangians that the ADM energy is positive for solutions close to flat space, and this is determined by the lowest-order terms R+����2 in the Lagrangian. The proof of this positive-energy theorem relies on the existence of the Einstein frame, since in the (Helmholtz-)Jordan frame the dominant energy condition does not hold and the field variables are unrelated to the total energy of the system. This is why we regard the Jordan frame as unphysical, while the Einstein frame is physical and reveals the physical contents of the theory. The latter should hence be viewed as physically equivalent to a self-interacting general-relativistic scalar field.},

This allows a natural separation of the (known) low energy quantum effects from the (unknown) high energy contributions. Within this framework, gravity is a well-behaved quantum field theory at ordinary energies. In studying the class of quantum corrections at low energy, the dominant effects at large distance can be isolated, as these are due to the propagation of the massless particles ( including gravitons) of the theory and are manifested in the nonlocal and/or nonanalytic contributions to vertex functions and propagators. These leading quantum corrections are parameter-free and represent necessary consequences of quantum gravity. The methodology is illustrated by a calculation of the leading quantum corrections to the gravitational interaction of two heavy masses.},

For two natural heating scenarios, the transition between inflation and radiation domination proceeds through a “graceful reheating” stage. The radiation temperature significantly exceeds the temperature of big bang nucleosynthesis. For this type of model, the observable consequences of the heating process can be summarized in a single parameter, the heating efficiency. Our quantitative analysis of compatibility with cosmological observations reveals the existence of realistic models able to describe the whole history of the Universe using only a single metric and scalar field and involving just a small number of order 1 parameters.},
