\section{INTRODUCTION}

\indent The simplest model of the Big Bang theory naturally follows from General Relativity applied to a general isotropic and homogeneous universe (Friedmann Equations) combined with Hubble's observations (Hubble's Law).  It is a highly successful theory, able to offer a comprehensive explanation for many experimental observations such as the CMB, the abundance of light elements, large-scale structure, and mainly, Hubble's Law. However, the model assumes a decelerating expansion dominated by matter or radiation, leading to fine-tuning problems like the horizon and flatness puzzles (discussed in Section \ref{The need for Inflation}).


The inflationary theory was developed in a series of papers by Guth \cite{GuthOriginalPaper}, Linde \cite{LINDE1982389}, Steinhardt 
\cite{PhysRevLett.48.1220}, and Starobinsky \cite{STAROBINSKY198099}, and is a paradigm that aims to explain the observed level of homogeneity and isotropy in the universe today. It posits that in the early universe, a small patch underwent a period of rapid exponential expansion where in all the initial inhomogeneities were wiped out. The main idea of the theory is as follows: during the early universe, there existed a homogeneous, isotropic field pervading through spacetime such that its potential energy was greater than its kinetic energy. This supplied the negative pressure required in the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) for gravity to become repulsive and cause the rapid exponential expansion necessary for inflation. Inflation terminates when the slow-roll conditions—characterized by small field acceleration and kinetic energy relative to potential energy—break down, triggering reheating into Standard Model particles.

While inflation is phenomenologically successful, it lacks a unique fundamental origin. Most models are ad hoc, constrained only by observational data on the inflaton potential’s slope and curvature. This paper argues that a particularly satisfying and vibrant inflationary model emerges by demanding local scale invariance (Weyl symmetry) for the inflaton-gravity system. Such a symmetry naturally restricts the Lagrangian’s form and links to broader theoretical principles like conformal invariance.

Scale invariance in cosmology seems quite an attractive hypothesis given the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primordial fluctuations as measured by Planck and WMAP, which might reflect the approximate conformal symmetry of the quasi–de Sitter phase during inflation. We also see that during inflation, the approximately de Sitter metric
\begin{equation} \label{1}
    \text{d}s^2 = \frac{1}{H^2\eta^2}(\text{d}\eta^2 - \text{d}\Vec{x}^2)
\end{equation} 
remains unchanged for a scale change corresponding to $\Vec{x} \rightarrow \lambda \Vec{x} \,\, \text{and} \,\, \eta \rightarrow \lambda \eta$ (where $\text{d}\eta =  \frac{\text{d}t'}{a(t')}$ is the conformal time), it therefore stands to reason that any EFT defined on this background must be scale invariant too, perhaps even locally. This is in line with how EFTs defined on Minkowski space are expected to obey the symmetries of the Lorentz group $SO^+(1,3)$. Much of the Starobinsky potential's success also arises from including the $R^2$ term in the Lagrangian, given $[R^2] = 4$ in natural units, its coefficient is naturally dimensionless and therefore invariant under change of scale $g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow \Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$, for $\Omega$ constant.

Another approach to inflationary cosmology is to consider metric-affine theories. This is done through the inclusion of the Holst invariant, a quantity that is already scale-invariant, in the Lagrangian. This has been explored in \cite{Salvio_2022} and \cite{pradisi2022equivalence}. The potential achieved in \cite{Salvio_2022} is identical to the one obtained through demanding scale invariance in \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal}, and the translation between the variables in the two theories will be given in Appendix \ref{Appendix A}. Finally, when considering the classical action of the Standard Model, dropping the Higgs mass terms, one finds that it too is scale-invariant and can be extended to be conformally invariant \cite{bars2014local}.

These investigations may hint towards a fundamental principle out of which these arise as limits - \textit{the inflaton potential arising} due to the gauging of this scale invariance, i.e., Weyl symmetry.

This paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{The need for Inflation} explains some of the problems with the naive big bang model. Section \ref{Inflation} explains how the introduction of a scalar field that violates the strong energy condition helps us resolve these issues and derives the formulae and tools necessary to analyse the particular model that we will present in section \ref{Scale Invariant Gravity}. This section will take up most of the content of the paper and will analyse the various regimes and scenarios that the model accommodates. Finally, section \ref{Section 5??} 5?? will compare the model with observational data.


\section{The need for Inflation}\label{The need for Inflation}
\subsection{Horizon Problem}
In this section, we will show that given the standard assumed expansion rate in the Big Bang model, we cannot satisfactorily explain the near-perfect uniformity of the CMB. This is because, given the rate of expansion, there is no way for distant regions of the CMB to have once been causally connected.
Given the Friedmann Equations and defining the Hubble constant $H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a}$,
\begin{equation} \label{1}
    \dot{\rho} = -3(\rho + p)H
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{2}
    \Ddot{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho + 3p)a
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}    \label{3}
    H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2} = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho
\end{equation}
From the continuity equation \ref{1}, we have:
\begin{equation} \label{4}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}  \ln(\rho)}{\mathrm{d} \ln(a)} = -3(1+w)
\end{equation}
Where, $w = \frac{p}{\rho}$. We can solve this equation to get $\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}$. In combination with Friedmann equation \ref{3} for a flat universe $k = 0$, we get the scale factor $a$ as a function of time $a(t)$.
\begin{equation}    \label{5}
    a(t) = \begin{cases}
        t^{2/3(1+w)} & w \neq -1 \\
        e^{Ht} & w = -1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Now, we can define the comoving horizon ($\tau$) as the causal horizon or the maximum distance a light ray can travel between times 0 and $t$.
\begin{equation}    \label{6}
    \tau \equiv \int_{0}^{t} \frac{\mathrm{d} t'}{a(t')} = \int_{0}^{a} \frac{\mathrm{d}a}{H a^2} = \int_{0}^{a} \mathrm{d} \ln(a) \frac{1}{aH}
\end{equation}
Therefore, for a conventional Big Bang model, the causal horizon $\tau$ for a universe with $w \geq 0$ increases with time. This means that the fraction of the universe in contact with each other increases with time.
\begin{equation}
    \tau \propto a^{1/2(1+3w)} \implies \tau = \begin{cases}
        a & \text{Radiation Dominated} \\
        a^{1/2} & \text{Matter Dominated}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The comoving horizon increasing with time implies that comoving scales (comoving scale is not the same as the physical scale) entering the cosmic horizon now were not in causal contact during the CMB decoupling! However, the anisotropy of the CMB is about one part in $10^{-5}$, posing a problem to the conventional big bang model to explain how these distant regions of the CMB managed to regulate their temperatures to such an accurate degree.

\subsection{Flatness Problem}
Despite the presence of mass and energy in our universe, the large-scale structure of our spacetime is approximately Euclidean (flat). To see whether this is a stable equilibrium, we return to Friedmann equation \ref{3} and defining $\rho_{\text{crit}} = 3H^2(a)$ and $\Omega(a) = \frac{\rho(a)}{\rho_{\text{crit}}}$, we get
\begin{equation}
    1 - \Omega(a) = \frac{-k}{(aH)^2}
\end{equation}
Differentiating this equation and using the Friedmann equations, we get,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}\Omega}{\mathrm{d} \ln a} = (1+3w)\Omega(\Omega-1)
\end{equation}
Looking at this, we can see that $\Omega = 1  \implies \rho = \rho_{crit}$ is an unstable equilibrium and slight perturbations can make the universe not flat, i.e., $k \neq 0$. This means that in the standard big bang model, matter density has to be extremely fine-tuned to fit the requirement $\rho = \rho_{crit}$, which seems unlikely.

The theory of inflation attempts to resolve the need for extreme fine-tuning of the initial conditions of the universe by positing a period of exponential expansion. The next section shows how this theory solves the two problems stated above.

\section{Inflation}\label{Inflation}
Looking at both the problems highlighted in the previous section, we see that the comoving Hubble radius ($(aH)^{-1}$) plays an important role
\begin{equation}    \label{10}
    \tau = \int_{0}^{a} \mathrm{d} \ln (a) \frac{1}{aH}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{11}
    1 - \Omega (a) = \frac{-k}{(aH)^2}
\end{equation}
If the comoving Hubble radius was decreasing, this means that large scales entering the present universe were inside the horizon before inflation. By equation \ref{11}, it also means that $\rho = \rho_{crit}$ is a stable equilibrium as the solution $\Omega = 1$ is an attractor during inflation.

A decreasing comoving horizon directly implies a period of accelerated expansion as seen by taking it's derivative
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{1}{aH} <  0 \implies \frac{-\Ddot{a}}{(aH)^2} < 0 \implies \ddot{a} > 0
\end{equation}
Given that $\ddot{a} > 0$ and Friedmann equation \ref{2}, we see that $\frac{\rho}{3} < p \implies w < - \frac{1}{3}$. This is a violation of the strong energy condition.

So far, we have described the physical implications of inflation and it's effects. In the following section, we shall describe the physical conditions under which such an exponential expansion can arise. 

\subsection{Canonical Scalar Field Inflation} \label{Canonical Scalar Field Inflation}
The simplest models of inflation involve a scalar field $\phi$ (The Inflaton Field) that acts as the perfect fluid with $w < -\frac{1}{3}$ such that upon coupling with gravity through the Einstein-Hilbert action, it can provide the repulsive force in the Friedmann equations for the accelerated expansion.

In this section, we shall consider a general non-canonical scalar field in the presence of gravity and derive the equations of motion and relevant parameters for such a scalar field. This will provide us with the necessary groundwork for what is to come later in our model.
\begin{equation}\label{12}
    S = \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g} \left[\frac{M_p^2}{2}R+ g^{\mu \nu} \frac{K(\phi)}{2} \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial_{\nu} \phi  - V(\phi) \right]\
\end{equation}
Using the methods described in \ref{3+1 decomposition of spacetime}
\begin{comment}
    \begin{equation}
        g_{\mu \nu} \text{d}x^\mu\text{d}x^\nu = -\alpha^2 \text{d}t^2 + a^2(t)\delta_{ij}\text{d}x^i\text{d}x^j
    \end{equation}
    This gives us $\sqrt{-g} = \alpha a^3(t)$
    We can now define a vector field on $\mathcal{M}_4$, $\bm{t}$, normal to $\Sigma_t$, such that under its flow, points on $\Sigma_t$ flow to the neighbouring hypersurface $\Sigma_{t+\delta t}$. This vector field can now be split into a spatial part (tangent to the hypersurface) and a normal part using the induced metric and the normal vector as such    
\end{comment}

    \textbf{CONTINUE FROM HERE!}
    
Given this, we can define 

\begin{comment}
    Since during the inflationary period, we assume a de Sitter space (minus the perturbations), the FLRW metric is given by $g_{\mu \nu}= \text{diag}[1,-a^2(t),-a^2(t),-a^2(t)]$ making $\sqrt{-g} = a^3(t)$. We also assume that the scalar field is homogeneous and, therefore only varies with time, allowing us to drop the gradient term. The action then becomes \cite{Baumann_2022}: 


\end{comment}
We see this aligns with the canonical scalar field when we set $K = 1$, getting  $ \ddot{\varphi} +  3H \dot{\varphi}  + V_{,\varphi}   = 0$. While this equation is nice, it turns out to be more useful in cosmology to record how the inflaton field changes with respect to the e-folding time ($N = \int H \text{d}t$). For this, let us take an aside and given the action \ref{12}, derive the energy-momentum tensor.
\begin{equation} 
    T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta S}{\delta  g^{\mu \nu}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial^\mu \phi)} \partial_\nu \phi - g_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{L}
\end{equation}
Using this, and simplifying the final expression we get, the energy density and the pressure of the fluid are as follows: 
\begin{align}   \label{18}
    \rho &= \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 + V(\varphi) \nonumber \\
    p &= \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 - V(\varphi)
\end{align}
Using the third Friedmann equation \ref{3}, we get:
\begin{equation}    \label{19}
    3 M_p^2H^2 = \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 + V(\varphi)
\end{equation}
Upon differentiating this expression with respect to time and using \ref{16}, we get:
\begin{equation} \label{20}
    2 M_p^2 \dot{H} = -  K \dot{\varphi}^2
\end{equation}
Now that we have all the relevant parameters as functions of the field, we can look at equation \ref{16} and replace the time derivative there with the derivative with respect to the e-folding time N. Using $\text{d}N = H \text{d}t$, we get our final answer of the field evolution as a differential equation with respect to N.
\begin{widetext}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{21}
    K\frac{\text{d}^2\varphi}{\text{d}N^2} +3 K \frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N}  - \frac{K^2}{2M_p^2} \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^3  +  \frac{K_{,\varphi}}{2}  \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^2 +  \left( 3 M_p^2 - \frac{K}{2} \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^2 \right) \frac{\text{d}\ln \text{V}(\varphi)}{\text{d} \varphi} = 0    
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{widetext}
\subsection{Slow Roll Inflation}
The acceleration equation for a universe dominated by the inflaton field with the energy density $\rho_{\phi}$ and pressure $p_{\phi}$, as defined in \ref{18} is given by the Friedmann equation \ref{2},
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho +3p) = -\frac{8\pi G}{3} (K(\phi){\dot{\phi}}^2 - V(\phi)) 
\end{equation}
We see that we can get $\ddot{a} > 0$ by requiring $K\dot{\phi}^2 << |V(\phi)|$. This period is called slow roll because when this condition is satisfied, it corresponds to the scalar field slowly rolling down its potential hill. The accelerated expansion will also only be satisfied for a long period if we require $|\ddot{\phi}| << 3H\dot{\phi} \sim |V,_{\phi}|$. To formalize this, start from equation \ref{20}:
\begin{equation} \label{23}
    \dot{\varphi}  = -  \frac{2 M_p^2}{K} H'
\end{equation}
Where we have denoted $\frac{dH}{d\varphi} = H'$ and using it in Equation \ref{19}, we get the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation \cite{copeland1993reconstructing}, \cite{salopek1990nonlinear} for inflation (where here, it has been applied to a non-canonical field in contrast with the references) :
\begin{equation}    \label{24}
    H'^2 - \frac{3K(\varphi)}{2M_p^2}H^2 = - \frac{K(\varphi) V(\varphi)}{2M_p^4} 
\end{equation}
While these equations are non-linear and impossible to solve except for power-law potentials and other simple models, we can see that the slow-roll approximation holds when the first term in \ref{24} can be ignored (leading to $V(\varphi) \approx 3M_p^2H^2$). This can be quantified with the parameter $\epsilon_H$ and requiring it to be less than 1. Dropping the terms $K\ddot{\varphi}$ and $K\dot{\varphi}^2$ terms in \cite{16} $\dot{\varphi} \approx \frac{V,_\varphi}{3HK}$, we can write this Hubble Slow Roll parameter in terms of the potential.
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_H = - M_p^2 \left(\frac{\dot{H}}{H} \right) = \frac{M_p^2}{2 K(\varphi)} \left(\frac{V,_\varphi}{V}\right)^2
\end{equation}
Using the equations \ref{23} and \ref{20}, the above equation can also be written as such:
\begin{equation} \label{26}
    \epsilon_H = - M_p^2  \frac{\dot{H}}{H^2} = - M_p^2 \left(\frac{1}{H}\frac{\text{d}H}{\text{d}N} \right)
\end{equation}
Which is more intuitive to interpret as measuring the relative change of the Hubble constant per e-folding time N. Using this, we can define the second Hubble slow-roll parameter $\eta_H$ as the change in $\epsilon_H$ per efold time.
\begin{equation}
    \eta_H = \frac{1}{\epsilon_H} \frac{\text{d}\epsilon_H}{\text{d}N}
\end{equation}
The requirement $\eta_H < 1$ can be seen as ensuring that inflation lasts for a long enough number of efolds. We can also define a potential slow-roll parameter $\eta_V$ as such:
\begin{equation}
    \eta_V = \frac{M_p^2}{K(\varphi)} \left( \frac{V_{,,\varphi}}{V} \right)^2 - \frac{M_p^2}{2} \frac{K_{,\varphi}}{K^2} \frac{V_{,\varphi}}{V}
\end{equation}
So far, these arguments only provide restrictions on the potential of the scalar field $\phi$ but make no attempt to motivate the form of the potential or the action principle for the field from first principles. Thus, we see that the theory of inflation refers to a whole host of theories that aim to explain the mechanism behind the period of exponential expansion that occurred when the universe was around $\geq 10^{-34}s$ old.

\textbf{Explain ns, r and their derivation}
\begin{comment}

\end{comment}

\textit{One of the ways to arrive at the action principle of the inflaton field is to take a leaf out of the playbook of many successful QFTs and to hypothesize a gauge condition. This is the approach that shall be taken in this project and will be explained more in the next section.}

\section{Scale Invariant Gravity} \label{Scale Invariant Gravity}
Having laid the groundwork, we now come to the primary study of this project. This is based on the paper \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal} mainly and will follow up on the idea and analyze the theory with the inclusion of gravity.

The theory of General Relativity is one of mankind's most rigorous scientific theories, is self-consistent and so far, all tests of GR have been shown to be in agreement with the theory. However, we do not \textit{a priori} know that the theory of general relativity can be extended to arbitrary energy (/length) scales. It is widely accepted that at high enough energy scales, those comparable to the Planck scale, GR breaks down. 

An interesting possibility to consider is that GR as we know it, with the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian being proportional to the Ricci Scalar, is a low-energy extrapolation of a more fundamental scale-invariant theory that describes physics at higher energies. 

In the argument that follows, we derive the most general conformally invariant action with non-irrelevant couplings of the inflaton field and gravity. We do not consider terms proportional to the curvature squared, even though this is a perfectly legal and general extension of the model. It is easy to show that this results in a two-field inflation model. We find, however, that the following model, which we will derive, is quite interesting and matches quite well with what is expected from an inflationary model. Let us begin by exploring this possibility with a spin-0 scalar field model that reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation at the lowest order of perturbation.
\begin{equation} \label{25}
    S = \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g} \frac{1}{2} \left[ \partial_\mu \delta \varphi \partial^\mu \delta \varphi - m^2   \delta\varphi^2   \right] + \text{gravity}
\end{equation}

The $m$ in this equation is just the coefficient of the quadratic term in the potential. It is there to ensure that the potential has a quadratic minima suitable for reheating, It is not exactly the mass \footnote{The concept of mass is tricky to define in deSitter space. The mass of a particle is given by one of its eigenvalues of the Casimir operators of the Poincaré group, the full symmetry group of standard Minkowski space. In deSitter space, this is, however, not the symmetry group we are working with, as a simple look at the de Sitter metric \ref{1} will show that it does not admit timelike Killing vectors, unlike Minkowski.} of the field.

Under local rescalings, the metric and the scalar transform as $g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow e^{2\rho} g_{\mu\nu} $ and  $\varphi \rightarrow e^{-\rho}\varphi$ respectively. To ensure the kinetic terms retain their form, we introduce the Weyl vector $B_\mu$ which transforms as such $B_{\mu} \rightarrow B_\mu - \partial_\mu \rho$ under the gauge transformation (going back to the roots of the word) and define the covariant derivative $D_\mu = \nabla_\mu - B_\mu$. To remove the explicit mass scale $m$ appearing in the Lagrangian \ref{25}, we add a compensator scalar field $\phi \rightarrow e^{-\rho}\phi$. For the gravity sector of the Lagrangian, let us see how the Christoffel symbol transforms under a local rescaling:
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} \rightarrow \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} +(\delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} \partial_\gamma \rho + \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} \partial_{\beta} \rho - g_{\beta \gamma}g^{\alpha \tau}\partial_{\tau}\rho)
\end{equation}
Defining a new connection that is conformally covariant using $B_\mu$ and using that to define the new curvature scalar, we get the Weyl curvature scalar:
\begin{align}
    \mathring{\Gamma}^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} &= \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} + (\delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} B_{\gamma} + \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} B_{\beta} - g_{\beta \gamma}g^{\alpha \tau}B_{\tau}) \nonumber \\
    \mathcal{R} &= R - 6 B_{\mu} B^{\mu} - 6 \nabla_\mu B^\mu
\end{align}
Putting all this together, we get the most general conformally invariant action that is linear in curvature:
\begin{widetext} 
\begin{subequations} \label{Starting Action}
\begin{align}
    S =\int \text{d}^4\text{x} \; \sqrt{-g} &\; \left[ ( \beta \varphi^2 + \gamma \phi \varphi +\alpha \phi^2) R - 6( \beta \varphi^2 + \gamma \phi \varphi +\alpha \phi^2) (B_{\mu} B^{\mu} + \nabla_\mu B^\mu) \right. \nonumber \\
    &\quad \left. +\frac{\epsilon}{2} D_{\mu}\varphi D^{\mu}\varphi + \frac{\sigma}{2} D_{\mu}\varphi D^{\mu}\phi + \frac{\nu}{2} D_{\mu}\phi D^{\mu}\phi \right. \left. - \frac{\mu}{2} \phi^2 \varphi^2 + \omega \phi_0^3 \varphi + \chi \phi_0 \varphi^3 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \varphi^4 + \frac{\kappa}{2} \phi^4 - \frac{\xi}{16} H_{\mu\nu}H^{\mu\nu} \right]  
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{widetext}
Where the parameters ${\beta, \gamma, \alpha, \epsilon, \sigma, \nu, \mu, \lambda, \kappa}$ are dimensionless parameters and $\hat{H}_{\mu\nu} \equiv [D_\mu,D_\nu]\phi = [\partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu]\phi$ is the field strength tensor. A point to note here is the abundance of dimensionless parameters. We can remove any two of these by rescaling our fields, but we will leave them in this form until necessary. In the proceeding discussions, we shall set $\lambda = \kappa = \omega = \chi= 0$, this can be reinstated in the end (Section \ref{Solution}), once the dynamics have been analyzed and the final inflaton potential is revealed without any loss in generality.

In the equation above, we find two scalar fields. This makes analyzing the equations of motion harder. However, we have a redundant degree of freedom granted to us through the Weyl invariance. Looking at the units of $[\phi] = 2$, we find that it is an inverse length. Since the action is written down to be invariant under any choice of scale, we can choose a particular local length scale such that the field $\phi$ no longer appears dynamical, that is, rescale the metric and fields such that $\phi(\text{x}^\mu) = \phi_0$ and "freeze it". The reparametrizations that allow us to do this are :
\[
g_{\mu \nu}\rightarrow\frac{\phi_0}{\phi}\,g_{\mu \nu},\quad 
\varphi\rightarrow\frac{\phi}{\phi_0}\,\varphi,\quad 
B_{\mu}\rightarrow B_{\mu} - \partial_{\mu}\ln(\phi)\,.
\] 
The resulting action in the Jordan Frame therefore reads:
\begin{equation}\label{29}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L} &= \Bigl(\beta\, \varphi^2 + \gamma\, \phi_0\, \varphi + \alpha\, \phi_0^2\Bigr)
\Bigl(R - 6\, B_{\mu} B^{\mu} - 6\, \nabla_{\mu} B^\mu\Bigr) \\
&\quad + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \Bigl(\partial_{\mu}\varphi - \Bigl(\varphi + \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}\,\phi_0\Bigr)B_{\mu}\Bigr)
\Bigl(\partial^{\mu}\varphi - \varphi\,B^{\mu}\Bigr) \\
&\quad - \frac{\mu}{2}\, \phi_0^2\,\varphi^2 
+ \frac{\nu\,\phi_0^2}{2}\,B_{\mu} B^{\mu} 
- \frac{\xi}{16}\,H_{\mu\nu} H^{\mu\nu}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
What we have here is that by gauging away the ``unphysical'' dynamics of the field $\phi$, the gauge field $B_\mu$ has acquired a Proca mass of $\nu \phi_0^2$. This is quite similar to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism \cite{anderson_plasmons_1963}, \cite{higgs_broken_1964}. In accordance with \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal}, we can send $\nu \rightarrow \infty$ to give us a Proca field $B_\mu$, (which could be a dark matter candidate \cite{Lasenby_2016}). In this regime, we can neglect the kinetic term corresponding to the Proca field, and it can be eliminated using the equations of motion as
\begin{equation}\label{30}
B_\mu = \frac{1}{2}\,\partial_\mu \ln\Bigl((\epsilon-12\beta)\,\varphi^2 + (\sigma-12\gamma)\,\phi_0\,\varphi + (\nu-12\alpha)\,\phi_0^2\Bigr)\,.
\end{equation}
and \ref{29} becomes:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{subequations}\label{33a}
\begin{align}
S = \int d^4x\, \sqrt{-g} \Biggl[ (\alpha\, \phi_0^2 + \beta\, \varphi^2 + \gamma\, \phi_0\,\varphi)R + 12\beta \Biggl\{1 - \frac{\phi_0^2}{48\beta\, V}\Bigl[(\sigma-12\gamma)^2 - 4(\epsilon-12\beta)(\nu-12\alpha)\Bigr]\Biggr\}
(\partial_{\mu}\varphi\, \partial^{\mu}\varphi) - \frac{\mu}{2}\,\phi_0^2\,\varphi^2 \Biggr],
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{widetext}
where $V = [(\epsilon - 12\beta) \varphi^2 + (\sigma - 12\gamma) \phi_0 \varphi + (\nu - 12\alpha)\phi^2_0]$. Now, by means of the following conformal transformation 
\[
g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow \Omega^2\,g_{\mu\nu},\quad\text{with}\quad \Omega^2 = \frac{M_p^2}{2(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)},
\]
we can move from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame and separate the Einstein-Hilbert action and the inflaton action. Denoting $M_p/\sqrt{2} = M$, we get:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{subequations}\label{33a}
\begin{align}
S = \int d^4x\, \sqrt{-g} &\Biggl[ M^2\, R + \,\frac{M^2}{(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)}
\frac{12\beta}{2}\Biggl\{1 - \frac{\phi_0^2}{48\beta\,V}\Bigl[(\sigma-12\gamma)^2-4(\epsilon-12\beta)(\nu-12\alpha)\Bigr]\Biggr\} (\partial_{\mu}\varphi\,\partial^{\mu}\varphi) \nonumber\\[2mm]
&\quad - \frac{3M^2}{2}\,\frac{(2\beta\,\varphi+\gamma\,\phi_0)^2}{(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)^2}\,(\partial_{\mu}\varphi\,\partial^{\mu}\varphi) - \frac{M^4}{(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)^2}\,\frac{\mu}{2}\,\phi_0^2\,\varphi^2 \Biggr].
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{widetext}
Denoting $A(\varphi) = (\beta\varphi^2+\gamma\phi_0\varphi+\alpha\phi_0^2)$ and $V(\varphi) = (\epsilon - 12\beta) \varphi^2 + (\sigma - 12\gamma) \phi_0  \varphi + (\nu - 12\alpha)\phi^2_0$. There are 6 free parameters here $\{ \beta, \gamma, \alpha , \epsilon, \sigma, \nu \}$. Using the redundancy in our choice of parameters in \ref{Starting Action}, we can reparametrize the fields $\varphi$ and $\phi_0$ and the parameters to absorb two of these dimensionless parameters. Therefore, we can choose
\[
\begin{split}
\text{V} &= \left[(\epsilon - 12\beta)\,\varphi^2 + (\sigma - 12\gamma)\,\phi_0\,\varphi + (\nu - 12\alpha)\,\phi_0^2\right] \\
         &= k\,*\left[\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2\right]
\end{split}
\]
Now only 4 dimensionless parameters still remain free; $\{k, \beta, \gamma, \alpha \}$.
\begin{equation} \label{Variable Dictionary}
    \begin{Bmatrix}
        \epsilon \\ \sigma \\ \nu 
    \end{Bmatrix}
    = (12+k)
    \begin{Bmatrix}
        \beta \\ \gamma \\ \alpha
    \end{Bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Discriminant $D = (\sigma -12 \gamma )^2-4 (\nu -12 \alpha ) (\epsilon -12 \beta ) = k^2 (\gamma^2 - 4\alpha \beta) = (\frac{k}{12+k})^2 (\sigma^2 -4 \epsilon \nu)$. This simplifies the equation \ref{33a} and we can write it as:
\begin{widetext}
    \begin{equation} 
    \begin{aligned}
        S &= \int \text{d}^4\text{x} \sqrt{-g} [ M^2 R + \frac{1}{2} \left[\ \frac{M^2(12+k)(4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2) \phi_0^2}{2(\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2)} \right] (\partial_\mu \varphi \partial^\mu \varphi) -  \frac{M^4}{A^2} \frac{\mu}{2} \phi^2_0 \varphi^2 ] 
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where again, $A =\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2$ and $M_p/\sqrt{2} = M$ has been used in the equation above.

The action is finally of the form $S = S_{\text{EH}} + S_{\text{INFLATON}}$. The inflaton action has the form of a non-canonical scalar field, with the kinetic and potential coefficients, $K(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$.

\subsection{Solution and Different Regimes} \label{Solution}
We now have all the relevant pieces to analyse the model, given the information in section \ref{Non-Canonical Scalar Field Inflation}  and \ref{Scale Invariant Gravity}. For the starting Lagrangian \ref{Starting Action}, using a neat parameter and field redefinition (which we have done with no loss in generality) given by \ref{Variable Dictionary}, we were able to simplify the action \ref{Starting Action} to one of the form $S_{EH} + S_{INFLATON}$. Now, looking at only the inflaton action alone, we have: 
\begin{equation}
    S_{INFLATON} = \int \text{d}^4x \left[ \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \partial_\mu \varphi \partial^\mu \varphi - V(\varphi)\right]
\end{equation}
where, the kinetic and potential terms, $K(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$ are given by:
\begin{align}
    \text{K}(\varphi) &= \left[\ \frac{M^2(12+k)(4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2) \phi_0^2}{2(\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2)} \right] \label{KE} \\
    \text{V}(\varphi) &= M^4  \frac{ \kappa \phi_0^4 + 2\omega \phi_0^3 \varphi +\mu \phi^2_0 \varphi^2 + 2\chi \phi_0 \varphi^3 + \lambda \varphi^4 }{2(\beta \varphi^2 + \gamma\phi_0\varphi + \alpha \phi_0^2)^2} \label{VE}
\end{align}
Where, in the final potential formula, we have reinstated $\lambda, \kappa$, $\omega$, and $\chi$.To canonicalize the action, that is, to write it in the form with no kinetic coefficient, we will need to redefine the field such that ($4\alpha \beta > \gamma^2$ has to be satisfied to avoid ghost instabilities):
\begin{equation} \label{40}
    \tilde{\varphi}(\varphi) = \int_0^{\varphi} \sqrt{K(x)} \text{d}x
\end{equation}
Using equation \ref{KE}, we get,
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\varphi}(\varphi) = \sqrt{\frac{12+k}{2}}M_p \arctan \left( \frac{2\varphi\beta + \gamma \phi_0}{\phi_0\sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2}} \right) + c
\end{equation}
Where $c$ is the integration constant dictating where the origin of the potential falls. For inflationary models, we can take it to be 0 without loss in generality or losing any physics. Inverting this relation, we get:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi(\tilde{\varphi}) = \frac{\phi_0}{2\beta} \Biggl[ \sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2} \tan\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}\frac{\tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) - \gamma \Biggr] 
\end{equation}
This redefinition also tells us that the original range $\varphi \in (-\infty,\infty)$ gets mapped to $\tilde{\varphi} \in \left( -\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2},\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$.Therefore using this inside the potential \ref{VE}, we get the potential $V(\varphi(\tilde{\varphi}))$, to get the final canonical inflaton action:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{INFLATON}} = \int \text{d}^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \tilde{\varphi}\partial^\mu \tilde{\varphi} - V(\varphi(\tilde{\varphi})) \right]
\end{equation}
An immediate consequence is that in the final formula, $\phi_0$ drops out, and we only have the dimensionless parameters to tune. This is interesting as this implies the energy scale at which scale-invariance is broken does not affect the final potential. We can make this explicit by writing the final potential as:
\begin{align}
    V(X(\tilde{\varphi})) &=  \frac{M_p^4}{8}  \frac{ \kappa + 2\omega X +\mu X^2 + 2\chi X^3 + \lambda X^4 }{(\beta X^2 + \gamma X + \alpha )^2} \label{Potential} \\
    X(\tilde{\varphi}) &= \frac{1}{2\beta} \Biggl[ \sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2} \tan\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}\frac{\tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) - \gamma \Biggr]  \label{X}
\end{align}
Where again we require $\tilde{\varphi} \in \left( -\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2},\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$
Analysing this potential, we can see at the limits, $\lim_{X \rightarrow \pm \infty} V(X) \approx \frac{M_p^4}{8} \frac{\lambda}{\beta}$. This shows that it plateaus at high $X$ or as $\tilde{\varphi} \rightarrow \frac{\pi}{2 C_k}$, where $C_k = \sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}M_p$. Denoting $A(X) = \beta X^2 + \gamma X + \alpha$, $N(X) = \kappa + 2\omega X +\mu X^2 + 2\chi X^3 + \lambda X^4$ and $D = \sqrt{4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2}$, we get that the slow roll parameter $\epsilon_V$ is:
\begin{align}
    \epsilon_V &= \frac{2C_k^2 M_p^2}{D^2} \left[ \frac{N'(X)}{N(X)} - \frac{A'(X)}{A(X)} \right]^2 
\end{align} 



\begin{comment}
    \epsilon_V &= \frac{4M_p^4}{(12+k)(4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2)} \left[ \frac{2\omega + 2\mu X + 6\chi X^2 + 4\lambda X^3}{\kappa + 2\omega X +\mu X^2 + 2\chi X^3 + \lambda X^4 } - \frac{2 \beta X + \gamma}{\beta X^2 + \gamma X + \alpha} \right]^2
    


    $\text{params} = [\alpha, \gamma,\beta, \epsilon, \sigma, \nu , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa]$
    After the variable parameterization, now only 4 dimensionless parameters still remain free; $\{\alpha, \gamma,\beta, \epsilon, \sigma , \nu\} \rightarrow \{k, \beta, \gamma, \alpha \}$.
    So now $\text{params} = [\alpha, \gamma,\beta, k , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa]$
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{Bmatrix}
            \epsilon \\ \sigma \\ \nu 
        \end{Bmatrix}
        = (12+k)
        \begin{Bmatrix}
            \beta \\ \gamma \\ \alpha
        \end{Bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{align}
        V({\tilde{\varphi}}) &= M^4  \frac{ \kappa \phi_0^4 + 2\omega \phi_0^3 \tilde{\varphi} +\mu^2 \phi^2_0 \tilde{\varphi}^2 + 2\chi \phi_0 \tilde{\varphi}^3 + \lambda \tilde{\varphi}^4 }{2(\beta \tilde{\varphi}^2 + \gamma\phi_0\tilde{\varphi} + \alpha \phi_0^2)^2} \nonumber \\
        \varphi(\tilde{\varphi}) &= \frac{\phi_0}{2\beta} \Biggl[ \sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2} \tan\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}\frac{\tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) - \gamma \Biggr] 
    \end{align}

\appendix

\section{Translating variables from Salvio to Barker} \label{Appendix A}

In the paper \cite{Salvio_2022}, the authors derived an inflaton potential using metric-affine gravity. The motivation here is to give inflation a geometrical explanation. 
By starting with this action, 
\begin{equation}
    S = \int \text{d}^4\text{x} \sqrt{-g} (\alpha \mathcal{R} + \beta \mathcal{R}' + c \mathcal{R}'^{2})
\end{equation}
Where $\mathcal{R}'$ is the Holst Invariant, a \textit{scale-invariant} quantity. The potential derived finally is: 
\begin{equation}
    U(\omega) = \frac{1}{4 c'} \left[ \frac{M_{p}^{2}}{4} \text{sinh}(\text{X}(\omega)) - \beta  \right]^2
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \text{X}(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{\omega}{M_{p}} + \text{tanh}^{-1} \left(\frac{4 \beta}{\sqrt{M_{p}^{4}+16 \beta^2}} \right)
\end{equation}

Barker \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal} derives a similar form of the potential starting with a scale-invariant scalar field. The resulting potential there is:

\begin{equation}
    U'(\varphi) = \frac{\mu^2 \phi_{0}^{4}}{2} \left[ \frac{\sigma}{2} + \sqrt{\nu - \frac{\sigma^2}{4}} \text{sinh}\left( \text{X}'(\varphi) \right)  \right]^2
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \text{X}'(\varphi) =  \frac{\varphi}{\phi_0 \sqrt{\nu - \frac{\sigma^2}{4}}} - \frac{c}{\phi_0 \sqrt{\nu - \frac{\sigma^2}{4}}}
\end{equation}

The substitutions necessary to transform back and forth from these models are: 

\begin{align}
    \phi_0 &= g \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} M_p  \nonumber \\
    \mu &= g^{-1} \frac{1}{6 \sqrt{2 c'}}  \nonumber \\
    \sigma &= - g^{-1} \frac{8 \beta}{M_{p}^{2}}  \nonumber \\
    \nu &= g^{-2} \left( 1 + \frac{16 \beta^2}{M_{p}^{4}} \right) \nonumber \\
    c  &= -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} M_{p} \text{tanh}^{-1} \left(\frac{4 \beta}{\sqrt{M_{p}^{4}+16 \beta^2}} \right)
\end{align}

where $g$ is a dimensionless coupling constant, this tells us that the Barker model has an extra degree of freedom that we can absorb into the definitions of the other variables.

\section{3+1 decomposition of spacetime} \label{3+1 decomposition of spacetime}
\textit{Before we proceed further, we have to consider how to treat the FLRW metric in calculations to make them simpler}. Given that the FLRW metric supposes spatial homogeneity and isotropy, a natural choice to analyse the metric and dynamics of this spacetime would be to slice the 4D spacetime $\mathcal{M}_4$ into a time-ordered sequence of 3D spacelike hypersurfaces $\Sigma_t$ such that on each hypersurface, time is constant \cite{baumann2012tasilecturesinflation}, 
\cite{gourgoulhon_31_2007}:
\begin{equation}
    \forall t \in \mathbb{R} : \Sigma_t = \{p \in \mathcal{M}_4 \, | \, \hat{t} (p) = t\} \nonumber
\end{equation}
Since $t$ (time) is always increasing and we want this slicing to cover all of spacetime, we require:
\begin{align}
    \Sigma_t \cap \Sigma_{t'} &= \emptyset \,\, \text{for}\,\, t \neq t' \nonumber \\
    \mathcal{M}_4 &= \bigcup_{t \in \mathbb{R}} \Sigma_t \nonumber
\end{align}
This allows us to to decompose the 4D manifold into a non-intersecting family of spacelike hypersurfaces such that $\mathcal{M}_4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \times \Sigma$, where $t \in \mathbb{R}$. On each hypersurface $\Sigma_t$, one can introduce a coordinate system $(x^i) = (x^1,x^2,x^3)$. For a well-behaved coordinate system on $\mathcal{M}_4$, we will require that this coordinate system varies smoothly between neighbouring hypersurfaces. Given a spacelike $\Sigma_t$, we can naturally define a unit normal 1-form 
\begin{equation} \label{unit 1-form}
    \underline{\bm{n}} = - \alpha \textbf{d}t    
\end{equation}
(Standard literature on this material uses N to denote the proportionality constant between the gradient 1-form and the 1-form $\underline{\bm{n}}$, but since we are going to be using $N$ for the efolding time, we will use $\alpha$ to avoid confusion). Using the full metric, we can also define a vector in $\mathcal{T_p}(\mathcal{M}_4)$ denoted by $\bm{n}$.

By looking at the orthogonal projection operator $\Vec{\mathbf{\gamma}} : \mathcal{T_p}(\mathcal{M}_4) \rightarrow \mathcal{T_p}(\Sigma_t)$, we can define an extended induced metric $\gamma_{\alpha\beta} = g_{\alpha\beta} + n_\alpha n_\beta$ (since $g^{\mu\nu} n_\mu n_\nu = -1$, we can define the inverse metric $\gamma^{\alpha\beta} = g^{\alpha\beta} + n^\alpha n^\beta$). This defines an induced metric on $\Sigma_t$, ensuring that vectors normal to the surface give a zero dot product and tangetial vectors maintain the same dot product structure inherited from the full manifold. 

Choosing the natural basis of $\mathcal{T}_p(\mathcal{M}_4)$ associated with the coordinates $(x^\alpha) =(t,x^i)$ as $(\bm{\partial}_\alpha)=(\bm{\partial}_t, \bm{\partial}_i)$. Given that this is dual to the 1-form basis $(\textbf{d}x^\alpha) = (\textbf{d}t, \textbf{d}x^i)$, we have $\langle \textbf{d}t, \bm{\partial}_t \rangle = 1$, so given equation \ref{unit 1-form}, we get $\bm{\partial}_t = \alpha \bm{n} + \bm{\beta}$, where the vector $\bm{\beta}$ is the ``shift'' vector tangent to the hypersurface ($\bm{\beta} = \beta^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i$). 

Now using the components of the 3-metric $\gamma_{i j}$ with respect to the coordinates $(x^i)$, we can write $\beta_i = \gamma_{ij}\beta^j$. The components of the metric $\bm{g}$ with respect to the coordinates $(x^\alpha)$ therefore are $\bm{g} \equiv g_{\alpha \beta} \textbf{d}x^\alpha \otimes \textbf{d}x^\beta$
By this definition, we see that we can extract the components of the metric by looking at it's action on the basis of the vector space. 
\begin{equation}
    g_{\alpha\beta} = \bm{g} (\bm{\partial}_\alpha, \bm{\partial}_\beta)
\end{equation}
This gives upon substitution of the $\bm{\partial}_t = \alpha \bm{n} + \bm{\beta}$:
\begin{equation}
    g_{\mu \nu} \text{d}x^\mu\text{d}x^\nu = -\alpha^2 \text{d}t^2 + \gamma_{ij}(\text{d}x^i + \beta^i \text{d}t)(\text{d}x^j + \beta^j \text{d}t)
\end{equation}
The vector $\alpha \bm{n}$ defines a vector field on $\mathcal{M}_4$, $\bm{t}$, normal to $\Sigma_t$, such that under its flow, points on $\Sigma_t$ flow to the neighbouring hypersurface $\Sigma_{t+\delta t}$. The shift vector $\bm{\beta}$ defines how coordinates ``shift'' from neighbouring spacelike hypersurface on the plane (tangent to $\Sigma_t$). 

So far, the discussion has been quite general; however, coming to the FLRW metric, which is spatially homogeneous and isotropic, we shall set $\beta^i = 0$. Giving us $g_{\mu \nu} \text{d}x^\mu\text{d}x^\nu = -\alpha^2 \text{d}t^2 + \gamma_{ij}\text{d}x^i\text{d}x^j$ (The equations of motion we get through $\beta^i$ give us momentum conservation),

The spatial slices $\Sigma_t$, homogeneous and isotropic 3-spaces, have constant 3-curvature. We can therefore choose one of three embeddings such that the curvature is either negative, zero, or positive. 

\section{Non-Canonical Scalar Field Inflation} \label{Non-Canonical Scalar Field Inflation}
A good part of this project was spent analysing a non-canonical scalar field. To do so, machinery distinct from the one displayed in section \ref{Canonical Scalar Field Inflation} was required. The following is the derivation for the same. Some of the equations derived have not been found elsewhere in literature (like the EOM for $\varphi$ as a function of N)
\begin{equation} \label{13}
    S = \int \text{dt}\text{d}^3\text{x} \; \text{a}^3(t) \left[ \frac{K(\varphi)}{2}\dot{\varphi}^2 - V(\varphi) \right]
\end{equation}
We vary the action and upon integrating by parts we get,
\begin{equation}
    \delta S = - \int \text{dt}\,\text{d}^3\textbf{x} \; \left[ a^3 K \ddot{\varphi} + a^3K_{,\varphi} \frac{\dot{\varphi}^2}{2}  +  3\dot{a} a^2 K \dot{\varphi} + a^3V_{,\varphi}  \right]\delta \varphi
\end{equation}
Setting this variation to zero, we get the equation of motion for a non-canonical scalar field.
\begin{equation} \label{16}
    K \ddot{\varphi} + \dot{\varphi} \left(\frac{K_{,\varphi} \dot{\varphi}}{2} + 3H K \right) + V_{,\varphi}   = 0
\end{equation}
