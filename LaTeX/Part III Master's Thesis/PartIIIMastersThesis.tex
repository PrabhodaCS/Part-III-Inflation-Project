    The theory of inflation attempts to resolve the need for extreme fine-tuning of the initial conditions of the universe by positing a period of exponential expansion. In this paper, we argue that a particularly satisfying and vibrant inflationary model emerges by demanding local scale invariance (Weyl symmetry) for the inflaton-gravity system. We will follow up on the idea and analyze the theory with the inclusion of gravity. We find that the following model is quite interesting and matches quite well with what is expected from an inflationary system.

\section{INTRODUCTION} \label{Introduction}

\indent The simplest model of the Big Bang theory naturally follows from General Relativity applied to a general isotropic and homogeneous universe (Friedmann Equations) combined with Hubble's observations (Hubble's Law).  It is a highly successful theory, able to offer a comprehensive explanation for many experimental observations such as the CMB, the abundance of light elements, large-scale structure, and mainly, Hubble's Law. However, the model assumes a decelerating expansion dominated by matter or radiation, leading to fine-tuning problems like the horizon and flatness puzzles (discussed in Section \ref{The need for Inflation}).


The inflationary theory was developed in a series of papers by Guth \cite{GuthOriginalPaper}, Linde \cite{LINDE1982389}, Steinhardt 
\cite{PhysRevLett.48.1220}, and Starobinsky \cite{STAROBINSKY198099}, and is a paradigm that aims to explain the observed level of homogeneity and isotropy in the universe today. It posits that in the early universe, a small patch underwent a period of rapid exponential expansion where all the initial inhomogeneities were wiped out. The main idea of the theory is as follows: during the early universe, there existed a homogeneous, isotropic field pervading through spacetime such that its potential energy was greater than its kinetic energy. This supplied the negative pressure required in the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) for gravity to become repulsive and cause the rapid exponential expansion necessary for inflation. Inflation terminates when the slow-roll conditions—characterized by small field acceleration and kinetic energy relative to potential energy—break down, triggering reheating into Standard Model particles.

While inflation is phenomenologically successful, it lacks a unique fundamental origin. Most models are ad hoc, constrained only by observational data on the inflaton potential’s slope and curvature. This paper argues that a particularly satisfying and vibrant inflationary model emerges by demanding local scale invariance (Weyl symmetry) for the inflaton-gravity system. Such a symmetry naturally restricts the Lagrangian’s form and links to broader theoretical principles like conformal invariance.

Scale invariance in cosmology seems quite an attractive hypothesis given the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primordial fluctuations as measured by Planck and WMAP, which might reflect the approximate conformal symmetry of the quasi–de Sitter phase during inflation. We also see that during inflation, which had approximately a de Sitter metric
\begin{equation} \label{deSitter Conformal}
    \text{d}s^2 = \frac{1}{H^2\eta^2}(\text{d}\eta^2 - \text{d}\Vec{x}^2)
\end{equation} 
remains unchanged for a scale change corresponding to $\Vec{x} \rightarrow \lambda \Vec{x} \,\, \text{and} \,\, \eta \rightarrow \lambda \eta$ (where $\text{d}\eta =  \frac{\text{d}t'}{a(t')}$ is the conformal time), it therefore stands to reason that any Effective Field Theory (EFT) defined on this background must be scale invariant too, perhaps even locally. This is in line with how EFTs defined on Minkowski space are expected to obey the symmetries of the Lorentz group $SO^+(1,3)$. Much of the Starobinsky potential's success also arises from including the $R^2$ term in the Lagrangian, given $[R^2] = 4$ in natural units, its coefficient is naturally dimensionless and therefore invariant under change of scale $g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow \Omega^2 g_{\mu\nu}$, for $\Omega$ constant.

Another approach to inflationary cosmology is to consider metric-affine theories. This is done through the inclusion of the Holst invariant, a quantity that is already scale-invariant, in the Lagrangian. This has been explored in \cite{Salvio_2022} and \cite{pradisi2022equivalence}. The potential achieved in \cite{Salvio_2022} is identical to the one obtained through demanding scale invariance in \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal}, and the translation between the variables in the two theories will be given in Appendix \ref{Appendix A}. Finally, when considering the classical action of the Standard Model, dropping the Higgs mass terms, one finds that it too is scale-invariant and can be extended to be conformally invariant \cite{bardeen1995naturalness, bars2014local}.

These investigations may hint towards a fundamental principle out of which these arise as limits - \textit{the inflaton potential arising} due to the gauging of this scale invariance, i.e., Weyl symmetry.

This paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{The need for Inflation} explains some of the problems with the naive big bang model. Section \ref{Inflation} describes how the introduction of a scalar field that violates the strong energy condition helps us resolve these issues and derives the formulae and tools necessary to analyse the particular model that we will present in section \ref{Scale Invariant Gravity}. Section \ref{Scale Invariant Gravity} will take up most of the content of the paper and here is where we will derive the effective potential of the inflaton model. We will also compare it to experimental data and show that it fits quite well.


\section{The need for Inflation}\label{The need for Inflation}
\subsection{Horizon Problem} \label{Horizon Problem}
In this section, we will show that given the standard assumed expansion rate in the Big Bang model, we cannot satisfactorily explain the near-perfect uniformity of the CMB. This is because, given the rate of expansion, there is no way for distant regions of the CMB to have once been causally connected.
Given the Friedmann Equations and defining the Hubble constant $H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a}$,
\begin{align}    
    \ddot{a} &= -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho + 3p)a \label{Friedmann Eqn 1} \\
    H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2} &= \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho \label{Friedmann Eqn 2} \\
    \dot{\rho} &= -3(\rho + p)H \label{Friedmann Eqn 3}
\end{align}
From the continuity equation \ref{Friedmann Eqn 3}, we have:
\begin{equation} \label{4}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}  \ln(\rho)}{\mathrm{d} \ln(a)} = -3(1+w)
\end{equation}
Where, $w = \frac{p}{\rho}$. We can solve this equation to get $\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}$. In combination with the Friedmann equation \ref{Friedmann Eqn 2} for a flat universe $k = 0$, we get the scale factor $a$ as a function of time $a(t)$.
\begin{equation}    \label{5}
    a(t) = \begin{cases}
        t^{2/3(1+w)} & w \neq -1 \\
        e^{Ht} & w = -1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Now, we can define the comoving horizon ($\tau$) as the causal horizon or the maximum distance a light ray can travel between times 0 and $t$.
\begin{equation}    \label{6}
    \tau \equiv \int_{0}^{t} \frac{\mathrm{d} t'}{a(t')} = \int_{0}^{a} \frac{\mathrm{d}a}{H a^2} = \int_{0}^{a} \mathrm{d} \ln(a) \frac{1}{aH}
\end{equation}
Therefore, for a conventional Big Bang model, the causal horizon $\tau$ for a universe with $w \geq 0$ increases with time. This means that the fraction of the universe in contact with each other increases with time.
\begin{equation}
    \tau \propto a^{1/2(1+3w)} \implies \tau = \begin{cases}
        a & \text{Radiation Dominated} \\
        a^{1/2} & \text{Matter Dominated}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The comoving horizon increasing with time implies that comoving scales (comoving scale is not the same as the physical scale) entering the cosmic horizon now were not in causal contact during the CMB decoupling! However, the anisotropy of the CMB is about one part in $10^{-5}$, posing a problem to the conventional big bang model to explain how these distant regions of the CMB managed to regulate their temperatures to such an accurate degree.

\subsection{Flatness Problem} \label{Flatness Problem}
Despite the presence of mass and energy in our universe, the large-scale structure of our spacetime is approximately Euclidean (flat). To see whether this is a stable equilibrium, we return to Friedmann equation \ref{Friedmann Eqn 2} and defining $\rho_{\text{crit}} = 3H^2(a)$ and $\Omega(a) = \frac{\rho(a)}{\rho_{\text{crit}}}$, we get
\begin{equation}
    1 - \Omega(a) = \frac{-k}{(aH)^2}
\end{equation}
Differentiating this equation and using the Friedmann equations, we get,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}\Omega}{\mathrm{d} \ln a} = (1+3w)\Omega(\Omega-1)
\end{equation}
Looking at this, we can see that $\Omega = 1  \implies \rho = \rho_{crit}$ is an unstable equilibrium and slight perturbations can make the universe not flat, i.e., $k \neq 0$. This means that in the standard big bang model, matter density has to be extremely fine-tuned to fit the requirement $\rho = \rho_{crit}$, which seems unlikely.

The theory of inflation attempts to resolve the need for extreme fine-tuning of the initial conditions of the universe by positing a period of exponential expansion. The next section shows how this theory solves the two problems stated above.

\section{Inflation}\label{Inflation}
Looking at both the problems highlighted in the previous section, we see that the comoving Hubble radius ($(aH)^{-1}$) plays an important role
\begin{equation}    \label{10}
    \tau = \int_{0}^{a} \mathrm{d} \ln (a) \frac{1}{aH}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{11}
    1 - \Omega (a) = \frac{-k}{(aH)^2}
\end{equation}
If the comoving Hubble radius was decreasing, this means that large scales entering the present universe were inside the horizon before inflation. By equation \ref{11}, it also means that $\rho = \rho_{crit}$ is a stable equilibrium as the solution $\Omega = 1$ is an attractor during inflation.

A decreasing comoving horizon directly implies a period of accelerated expansion as seen by taking it's derivative
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{1}{aH} <  0 \implies \frac{-\Ddot{a}}{(aH)^2} < 0 \implies \ddot{a} > 0
\end{equation}
Given that $\ddot{a} > 0$ and Friedmann equation \ref{Friedmann Eqn 1}, we see that $p < -\frac{\rho}{3} \implies w < - \frac{1}{3}$. This is a violation of the strong energy condition.

So far, we have described the physical implications of inflation and it's effects. In the following section, we shall describe the physical conditions under which such an exponential expansion can arise. 

\subsection{Canonical Scalar Field Inflation} \label{Canonical Scalar Field Inflation}
The simplest models of inflation involve a scalar field $\varphi$ (The Inflaton Field) that acts as the perfect fluid with $w < -\frac{1}{3}$ such that upon coupling with gravity through the Einstein-Hilbert action, it can provide the repulsive force in the Friedmann equations for the accelerated expansion.

In this section, we shall consider a scalar field in the presence of gravity and derive the equations of motion (EOM) and relevant parameters for such a scalar field. This will provide us with the necessary groundwork for what is to come later in our model (We shall work in the mostly minus convention).
\begin{equation}\label{Start of derivation}
    S = \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g} \left[-\frac{M_p^2}{2}R+ \frac{g^{\mu \nu}}{2} \partial_{\mu}\varphi \partial_{\nu} \varphi  - V(\varphi) \right]\
\end{equation}
Using the methods described in Appendix \ref{3+1 decomposition of spacetime}, we can now split the action integral into one over space and one over time and make the Cauchy problem well-defined. Given certain conditions on the spacetime, it has been proven that, given initial conditions, the evolution of the fields described on the spacelike hypersurface has a unique evolution \cite{choquet-bruhat_global_1969}. Therefore, 
\[
    S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathrm{d}t  \int_\mathcal{V}  \alpha a^3(t) \bigg[-\frac{M_p^2}{2}R+  \frac{1}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 - \frac{1}{2} \gamma^{ij}\partial_{i}\varphi \partial_{j} \varphi  - V(\varphi) \bigg]    
\]
Since during the inflationary period, we assume an approximately de Sitter space (minus the perturbations), the FLRW metric is given by $g_{\mu \nu}= \alpha^2 \text{d}t^2 - \gamma_{ij}\text{d}x^i\text{d}x^j$ (derived from the full general metric in the appendix \ref{3+1 decomposition of spacetime} equation \ref{General split Metric}. Using the spatially homogeneous and isotropic nature of the FLRW, we can set $\beta^i = 0$) making $\sqrt{-g} = \alpha a^3(t) \sqrt{\gamma}$. We also assume that the scalar field is homogeneous and, therefore, only varies with time, allowing us to drop the gradient term. Using the form of the Ricci scalar in the FLRW metric, we get:
\begin{align}
    S = \mathcal{V} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathrm{d}t \big[-3M_p^2 \left( \frac{- a \dot{a}^2}{\alpha} + \alpha ak\right)+  \frac{ a^3(t)}{2\alpha} \dot{\varphi}^2 \nonumber \\
    - \alpha a^3(t) V(\varphi) \big]    
\end{align}
Using the Euler-Lagrange Equations for $\alpha, a(t) \, \text{and} \, \varphi$ respectively, gives us the EOM:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \left(\frac{\dot a}{\alpha\,a}\right)^2 + \frac{k}{a^2}
  &=& \frac{1}{3M_p^2}\Bigl(\tfrac12\,\alpha^{-2}\dot\varphi^2 + V(\varphi)\Bigr),
  \nonumber\\
  \frac{2\,\ddot a}{\alpha^2\,a}
  + \left(\frac{\dot a}{\alpha\,a}\right)^2
  + \frac{k}{a^2}
  &=& -\,\frac{1}{M_p^2}\Bigl(\tfrac12\,\alpha^{-2}\dot\varphi^2 - V(\varphi)\Bigr),
  \nonumber\\
  \ddot\varphi + 3\!\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)\dot\varphi
  + V_{,\varphi}
  &=& 0. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
We see that the EOM imply $\alpha$ to be an arbitrary constant, which we can choose to be 1 with no loss in generality. Writing them more suggestively, we get:
\begin{align}
    H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2} &= \frac{1}{3M_p^2} \bigg( \frac{\dot{\varphi}^2}{2} + V(\varphi) \bigg) \label{First 1} \\
    \frac{ \ddot{a}}{a}  &=  \frac{1}{3M_p^2}\left(\dot{\varphi}^2 - V(\varphi) \right) \label{First 2} \\
    \ddot{\varphi} + 3H\dot{\varphi} + V_{,\varphi} &= 0    \label{KGEOM}
\end{align}

\begin{comment}
    \begin{equation}
        g_{\mu \nu} \text{d}x^\mu\text{d}x^\nu = -\alpha^2 \text{d}t^2 + a^2(t)\delta_{ij}\text{d}x^i\text{d}x^j
    \end{equation}
    This gives us $\sqrt{-g} = \alpha a^3(t)$
    We can now define a vector field on $\mathcal{M}_4$, $\bm{t}$, normal to $\Sigma_t$, such that under its flow, points on $\Sigma_t$ flow to the neighbouring hypersurface $\Sigma_{t+\delta t}$. This vector field can now be split into a spatial part (tangent to the hypersurface) and a normal part using the induced metric and the normal vector as such    
\end{comment}
The first two equations \ref{First 1}, \ref{First 2}, correspond to the first two Friedmann equations \ref{Friedmann Eqn 2} , \ref{Friedmann Eqn 1} respectively, if we make the following identification:
\begin{align}   \label{presure and density}
    \rho &= \frac{1}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 + V(\varphi) \nonumber \\
    p &= \frac{1}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 - V(\varphi)
\end{align}
(These can also be derived from calculating the energy momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta S}{\delta  g^{\mu \nu}}$).
The third equation \ref{KGEOM} is the scalar field equation of motion for a spin-zero particle in the FLRW metric with the potential V. 
\begin{comment}
    Since during the inflationary period, we assume a de Sitter space (minus the perturbations), the FLRW metric is given by $g_{\mu \nu}= \text{diag}[1,-a^2(t),-a^2(t),-a^2(t)]$ making $\sqrt{-g} = a^3(t)$. We also assume that the scalar field is homogeneous and, therefore only varies with time, allowing us to drop the gradient term. The action then becomes \cite{Baumann_2022}: 
\end{comment}
 To derive the EOM of the inflaton field with respect to the e-folding time ($N = \int H \text{d}t$), we use the third Friedmann equation (The first Friedmann equation is generally given by \ref{3}, which includes a term proportional to $k$. However, a sufficiently long period of inflation drives the curvature term $k/a$ to be negligible. Furthermore, current observational data are highly consistent with a spatially flat universe; $k=0$), we get:
\begin{equation}    \label{Friedmann 3}
    3 M_p^2H^2 = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 + V(\varphi)
\end{equation}
Upon differentiating this expression with respect to time and using \ref{KGEOM}, we get:
\begin{equation} \label{H vs phi}
    2 M_p^2 \dot{H} = -   \dot{\varphi}^2
\end{equation}
Now that we have all the relevant parameters as functions of the field, we can look at equation \ref{16} and replace the time derivative there with the derivative with respect to the e-folding time N. Using $\text{d}N = H \text{d}t$, we get our final answer of the field evolution as a differential equation with respect to N.
\begin{widetext}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{phi vs N}
    \frac{\text{d}^2\varphi}{\text{d}N^2} +3 \frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N}  - \frac{1}{2M_p^2} \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^3   +  \left( 3 M_p^2 - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^2 \right) \frac{\text{d}\ln \text{V}(\varphi)}{\text{d} \varphi} = 0    
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{widetext}

\subsection{Slow Roll Inflation} \label{Slow Roll Inflation}
The acceleration equation for a universe dominated by the inflaton field with the energy density $\rho_{\varphi}$ and the pressure $p_{\varphi}$, as defined in \ref{presure and density} is given by the Friedmann equation \ref{Friedmann Eqn 1},
\[
\frac{\ddot a}{a}
=-\tfrac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho_\varphi+3p_\varphi)
=-\tfrac{8\pi G}{3}(\dot\varphi^2-V(\varphi))\,.
\]
Accelerated expansion ($\ddot{a} > 0$) therefore requires $\dot{\varphi}^2 \ll |V(\varphi)|$. This period is called slow roll because when this condition is satisfied, it corresponds to the scalar field slowly rolling down its potential hill. The accelerated expansion will also only be satisfied for a long period if we require $|\ddot{\varphi}| \ll 3H\dot{\varphi} \sim |V,_{\varphi}|$. To formalize this, start from equation \ref{H vs phi}:
\begin{equation} \label{Hp vs phi}
    \dot{\varphi}  = -  2 M_p^2 H'
\end{equation}
Where we have denoted $\frac{dH}{d\varphi} = H'$ and using it in Equation \ref{19}, we get the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation \cite{copeland1993reconstructing, salopek1990nonlinear} for inflation:
\begin{equation}    \label{Hamilton-Jacobi}
    H'^2 - \frac{3}{2M_p^2}H^2 = - \frac{V(\varphi)}{2M_p^4} 
\end{equation}
While these equations are non-linear and impossible to solve except for power-law potentials and other simple models, we can see that the slow-roll approximation holds when the term $\dot{\varphi}^2 \ll V(\varphi)$ in \ref{Friedmann 3} can be ignored (leading to $V(\varphi) \approx 3M_p^2H^2$). This can be quantified with the parameter $\epsilon_H$ and requiring it to be less than 1. Dropping the term $\ddot{\varphi}$ term in \ref{KGEOM} $\dot{\varphi} \approx -\frac{V,_\varphi}{3H}$, we can write this Hubble Slow Roll parameter in terms of the potential.
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_H = - \left(\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2} \right) \approx \frac{M_p^2}{2} \left(\frac{V,_\varphi}{V}\right)^2
\end{equation}
\begin{comment}
    Using the equations \ref{H vs phi} and \ref{Hp vs phi}, the above equation can also be written as such:
    \begin{equation} \label{26}
        \epsilon_H = -  \frac{\dot{H}}{H^2} = -  \left(\frac{1}{H}\frac{\text{d}H}{\text{d}N} \right)
    \end{equation}
        Which is more intuitive to interpret as measuring the relative change of the Hubble constant per e-folding time N. Using this, we can define the second Hubble slow-roll parameter $\eta_H$ as the change in $\epsilon_H$ per efold time.
    \begin{equation}
        \eta_H = \frac{1}{\epsilon_H} \frac{\text{d}\epsilon_H}{\text{d}N}
    \end{equation}
    The requirement $\eta_H < 1$ can be seen as ensuring that inflation lasts for a long enough number of efolds. We can also define a potential slow-roll parameter $\eta_V$ as such:
\end{comment}
To ensure that inflation lasts for a long enough time, we would require that the potential 
\begin{equation}
    \eta_V = M_p^2  \frac{V_{,,\varphi}}{V} 
\end{equation}
\subsection{Inflationary Observables} \label{Inflationary Observables}
Inflation is a robust theory not only because it solves the Horizon and Flatness problems \ref{Horizon Problem}, \ref{Flatness Problem}, it also makes predictions about the inhomogeneities in the early universe. These primordial density fluctuations are due to the inherent quantum nature of the inflaton field. 
The fluctuations in the inflaton field $\delta\varphi$ cause different patches of spacetime to have different amounts of inflation as the field has not exited slow-roll in certain regions yet. 

These fluctuations can be treated as perturbations around a background field ($\delta\varphi(t,\textbf{x}) = \varphi(t,\textbf{x}) - \Bar{\varphi}(t)$). However, as is known, by the Einstein Field Equations $\delta G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{M_p^2}\delta T_{\mu \nu}$, perturbations in the matter density cause perturbations in the metric too. Therefore, we can expand the metric around it's background value similarly as $g_{\mu\nu}(t,\textbf{x}) = \Bar{g}_{\mu\nu}(t) + \delta g_{\mu\nu}(t,\textbf{x})$. Generally, these metric perturbations $\delta g_{\mu\nu}(t,\textbf{x})$ have 10 independent components, but these can be decomposed into scalar, vector, and tensor (SVT) perturbations \cite{liddle_cosmological_2000, malik_cosmological_2009}. Using conformal time and writing the background metric in the same form as equation \ref{deSitter Conformal}, we get the perturbation to the metric to be of the form:
\begin{equation} \label{Perturbed metric}
    \delta g_{\mu\nu}
    = 
    -a^2
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -2 \Phi & \partial_iB \\
        \partial_iB & (1-2\Psi)\delta_{ij} + E_{ij} 
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Where $E_{ij} = 2\partial_i\partial_j E + h_{ij}$. There are 4 independent contributions $(\Phi, B, \Psi, E)$ which behave as scalars under transformation of frames and the transverse, traceless ($h_i^i = \partial^ih_{ij} = 0$), and symmetric tensor contribution $h_{ij}$ to the perturbed metric. We have neglected terms corresponding to the vector perturbations as they are not created by inflation, and as they also decay with the expansion of the universe. The reason we would prefer to split the metric perturbation into these three types is that at linear order, the Fourier modes decouple, and we can analyse them separately. 

However, with a change in coordinates, while the tensor contributions remain the same, the scalar functions change. Therefore, by a suitable choice of coordinates, we could remove the inhomogeneities in the inflaton field $\delta \varphi(\textbf{x}',t') = 0$. To analyse these perturbations, it is important to introduce gauge-invariant quantities. An obvious choice would be to consider the intrinsic curvature of the spatial hypersurface ${}^{(3)}R$ (See Appendix \ref{3+1 decomposition of spacetime}). However, it is easier to work with a related quantity that makes no reference to the scale factor and is normalised. This quantity can therefore be defined as:
\begin{equation} \label{comoving curvature perurbation}
    \mathcal{R} \equiv 4 \frac{k^2}{a^2} {}^{(3)}R = \Psi - \frac{H}{\dot{\Bar{\varphi}}}\delta \varphi
\end{equation}
This is called the comoving curvature perturbation ($k$ here corresponds to the wavenumber of a Fourier mode). Another quantity of interest is the two polarization modes of the tensor perturbation $h_{ij}$, that is, $h \equiv h^+ , h^\times$, these are the gravitational waves generated due to inflation. The observables we can constrain from these two quantities are the scalar and tensor power spectra ($P_\mathcal{R}(k)$ and $P_h(k)$), respectively:
\begin{align}
    \langle \mathcal{R}_{\bm{k}} \mathcal{R}_{\bm{k}'} \rangle &= (2\pi)^3 \delta(\bm{k}+\bm{k}')P_\mathcal{R}(k) \\
    \langle h_{\bm{k}} h_{\bm{k}'} \rangle &= (2\pi)^3 \delta(\bm{k}+\bm{k}')P_h(k)
\end{align}
Defining $\Delta_s^2 = \frac{k^3}{2\pi^2} P_\mathcal{R}(k)$ and $\Delta_t^2 = \frac{k^3}{\pi^2} P_h(k)$ (upon summing over the two polarizations, we lose a factor of 2 in the denominator in the definition of $\Delta_t^2$), we get the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, often called the scalar tilt as follows
\begin{equation}
    n_s - 1 \equiv \frac{\text{d} \ln \Delta_s^2}{\text{d} \ln k}
\end{equation}
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is defined as the normalized value of the amplitude of the tensor fluctuations with respect to the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations:
\begin{equation}
    r \equiv \frac{\Delta_t^2(k)}{\Delta_s^2(k)}
\end{equation}
The scalar tilt (also called the scalar spectral index) measures how the curvature perturbation spectrum scales with wavenumber $P_\mathcal{R}(k) = A_s\big(\frac{k}{k_*}\big)^{n_s-1}$, where $A_s$ is the amplitude of the scalar perturbation and $k_*$ is the pivot scale, the comoving wavenumber at which the the amplitude is defined. $n_s = 1$ corresponds to a scale-invariant spectrum (Harrison‑Zeldovich \cite{harrison_fluctuations_1970, zeldovich_hypothesis_1972, peebles_primeval_1970}). $n_s < 1$ implies that there is more power at smaller $k$ (larger scales) and $n_s > 1$ implies that there is more power at larger $k$ (smaller scales). 

The latest Planck data \cite{collaboration_planck_2020} constrains these values to around $n_s = 0.9649 \pm 0.0042$, which strongly rules out the Harrison‑Zeldovich spectrum with a confidence of $8.4\sigma$. However, it still shows that the spectrum is  \textit{nearly} scale-invariant, with $P_\mathcal{R}(k) \propto k^{-0.0351}$. For $r$, the Planck data constrains the upper limit to $r_{0.002} < 0.056$ at the pivot scale $k_* =0.002 \text{Mpc}^{-1}$

At leading order in slow-roll, the power=spectrum is related to the slow-roll parameters by \cite{liddle_cosmological_2000}:
\begin{equation}
    P_\mathcal{R}(k) \approx \frac{1}{24\pi^2 M_p^4} \frac{V}{\epsilon_V}
\end{equation}
Using the slow roll condition $\text{d}t = -(3H/V') \text{d}\varphi$, we find:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d} \ln k} \epsilon_V = -M_p^2 \frac{V'}{V}\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\varphi}\epsilon_V = 2\epsilon_V\eta_V - 4\epsilon_V^2
\end{equation}
Putting this together, we get $n_s \approx 1 -6\epsilon_V +2\eta_V$ and similar analysis \cite{baumann2012tasilecturesinflation} gives us $r \approx 16 \epsilon_V$ at the horizon crossing scale $k = aH$.


\section{Scale Invariant Gravity} \label{Scale Invariant Gravity}
So far, these arguments only provide restrictions on the potential of the scalar field $\varphi$ but make no attempt to motivate the form of the potential or the action principle for the field from first principles. Thus, we see that the theory of inflation refers to a whole host of theories that aim to explain the mechanism behind the period of exponential expansion that occurred when the universe was around $\geq 10^{-36}s$ old \cite{Mukhanov:2005sc, Baumann_2022}.

The goal of this paper is to argue that, given the arguments in the introduction \ref{Introduction}, local scale invariance seems to be a natural starting point to motivate an inflaton action. Many actions written down in inflationary physics do include terms that tend to make the action scale invariant at high energies. We propose here that this scale invariance is fundamental and a local property of spacetime at high energies that is spontaneously broken.

Having laid the groundwork, we now come to the primary study of this project. This is based on some of the arguments made in the paper  \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal} about motivating an inflaton field through the principle of local scale invariance, and will follow up on the idea and analyze the theory with the inclusion of gravity.

The theory of General Relativity (GR) is one of mankind's most self-consistent, rigorous scientific theories; so far, all tests have been shown to be in agreement with the theory. However, the common consensus is that GR is an EFT applicable only at low energies. While there have been attempts to UV complete the theory, a naive perturbation expansion introduces new operators with new parameters, thereby reducing its predictive power.

An interesting possibility to consider is that possibly, some of the more ``weird'' behavior of the universe's expansion, namely, inflation, could arise due to the degrees of freedom in the UV theory that we have integrated out. 

What we propose here therefore, following the arguments made in the introduction \ref{Introduction} (and \textbf{add stuff}), that GR as we know it, with the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian being proportional to the Ricci Scalar, is a low-energy extrapolation of a more fundamental locally scale-invariant theory that describes physics at higher energies. 

In the argument that follows, we derive the most general conformally invariant action with non-irrelevant couplings of the inflaton field and gravity. We do not consider terms proportional to the curvature squared, even though this is a perfectly legal and general extension of the model. It is easy to show that this results in a two-field inflation model. We find, however, that the following model, which we will derive, is quite interesting and matches quite well with what is expected from an inflationary model. Let us begin by exploring this possibility with a spin-0 scalar field model that reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation at the lowest order of perturbation.
\begin{equation} \label{25}
    S = \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g} \frac{1}{2} \left[ \partial_\mu \delta \varphi \partial^\mu \delta \varphi - m^2   \delta\varphi^2   \right] + \text{gravity}
\end{equation}

The $m$ in this equation is just the coefficient of the quadratic term in the potential. It is there to ensure that the potential has a quadratic minimum suitable for reheating. It is not exactly the mass \footnote{The concept of mass is tricky to define in de Sitter space. The mass of a particle is given by one of its eigenvalues of the Casimir operators of the Poincaré group, the full symmetry group of standard Minkowski space. In de Sitter space, this is, however, not the symmetry group we are working with, as a simple look at the de Sitter metric (Equation \ref{deSitter Conformal}) will show that it does not admit timelike Killing vectors, unlike Minkowski. \label{Footnote 1}} of the field.

Under local rescalings, the metric and therefore the volume element transform as $g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow e^{2\rho} g_{\mu\nu} $ and $\sqrt{-g} \rightarrow e^{4\rho} \sqrt{-g}$. Scalar fields transform as $\varphi \rightarrow e^{-\rho}\varphi$. To ensure the kinetic terms retain their form, we introduce the Weyl vector $B_\mu$ which transforms as such $B_{\mu} \rightarrow B_\mu - \partial_\mu \rho$ under the gauge transformation (going back to the roots of the word) and define the covariant derivative $D_\mu = \nabla_\mu - B_\mu$ such that we can write the purely kinetic part of this action as:
\[
    S = \int \text{d}^4 \text{x} \sqrt{-g} \frac{g^{\mu\nu}}{2} D_\mu \varphi D_\nu \varphi
\]
Under a local rescaling of the metric, the kinetic term $D_\mu \varphi D_\nu \varphi \rightarrow e^{2\rho}$ while the metric and the volume element transform as indicated above, therefore the combination in the above equation remains invariant, i.e., the action does not change. To remove the explicit mass scale $m$ appearing in the action \ref{25}, we add a compensator scalar field $\phi \rightarrow e^{-\rho}\phi$ such that
\[
\mathcal{L}_\text{Matter} \propto \frac{1}{2} D_\mu \varphi D^\mu \varphi - \frac{\mu}{2} \phi^2 \varphi^2 + \frac{1}{2} D_\mu \phi D^\mu \phi 
\]
For the gravity sector of the Lagrangian, let us see how the Christoffel symbol transforms under a local rescaling:
\[
    \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} \rightarrow \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} +(\delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} \partial_\gamma \rho + \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} \partial_{\beta} \rho - g_{\beta \gamma}g^{\alpha \tau}\partial_{\tau}\rho)
\]
Defining a new connection that is conformally covariant using $B_\mu$ and using that to define the new curvature scalar, we get the Weyl curvature scalar:
\begin{align}
    \mathring{\Gamma}^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} &= \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta \gamma} + (\delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} B_{\gamma} + \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} B_{\beta} - g_{\beta \gamma}g^{\alpha \tau}B_{\tau}) \nonumber \\
    \implies \mathring{R} &= R - 6 B_{\mu} B^{\mu} - 6 \nabla_\mu B^\mu
\end{align}
However, under a local rescaling, this new curvature scalar still transforms with only Weyl weight\footnote{The Weyl weight of a field $\Phi$ is defined as the power of the conformal factor by which it transforms under a local rescaling. It is $\Delta$ if $\Phi \rightarrow e^{-\Delta\rho}\Phi$} 2, that is, $\mathring{R} \rightarrow e^{-2\rho} \mathring{R}$. This means that, for the gravitational part of our action, we must have a non-minimal coupling of our scalar fields and the Weyl Scalar to give the action Weyl weight 0.
\[
    \mathcal{L}_\text{Gravity} \propto ( \beta \varphi^2 + \gamma \phi \varphi +\alpha \phi^2) \mathring{R}
\]
Putting all this together, we get the most general locally scale action that is linear in curvature, including all non-irrelevant terms:
\begin{widetext} 
    \begin{equations} 
    \begin{align}  \label{Starting Action} 
        S =\int \text{d}^4\text{x} \; \sqrt{-g} &\; \left[ -( \beta \varphi^2 + \gamma \phi \varphi +\alpha \phi^2) R + 6( \beta \varphi^2 + \gamma \phi \varphi +\alpha \phi^2) (B_{\mu} B^{\mu} + \nabla_\mu B^\mu) \right. \nonumber \\
        &\quad \left. +\frac{\epsilon}{2} D_{\mu}\varphi D^{\mu}\varphi + \frac{\sigma}{2} D_{\mu}\varphi D^{\mu}\phi + \frac{\nu}{2} D_{\mu}\phi D^{\mu}\phi \right. \left. - \omega \phi^3 \varphi - \frac{\mu}{2} \phi^2 \varphi^2  - \chi \phi \varphi^3 - \frac{\lambda}{2} \varphi^4 - \frac{\kappa}{2} \phi^4 - \frac{\xi}{16} H_{\mu\nu}H^{\mu\nu} \right]  
    \end{align}
    \end{equations}
\end{widetext}
\textbf{Jordan And Einstein Frames?}
Such an action where the curvature is coupled to some arbitrary function of the scalar fields is called the Jordan Frame. Upon variation of the action, we get very different EOM from the EFEs. However, in this frame, particles still move on geodesics. We can move to the typical action where the gravitational part of the action is an Einstein-Hilbert term through a Weyl transformation. This frame is called 

We have also included terms that couples the derivatives of the two fields $\phi$ and $\varphi$ and the field strength tensor $\hat{H}_{\mu\nu}\varphi \equiv [D_\mu,D_\nu]\varphi$ as these too remains invariant under local rescalings. The 11 parameters $\{\beta, \gamma, \alpha, \epsilon, \sigma, \nu, \omega, \mu, \chi ,\lambda, \kappa\}$ and $\xi$ are dimensionless parameters. A point to note here is the abundance of dimensionless parameters. We can remove any two of these by rescaling our fields, but we will leave them in this form until necessary. This will come in handy later on. In the proceeding discussions, we shall set $\lambda = \kappa = \omega = \chi= 0$, this can be reinstated in the end (Section \ref{Solution}), once the dynamics have been analyzed and the final inflaton potential is revealed without any loss in generality.

In the equation above, we find two scalar fields. This makes analyzing the EOM harder. However, we have a redundant degree of freedom through Weyl invariance. Looking at the units of $[\phi] = 2$, we find that it is an inverse length. Since the action is written down to be invariant under any choice of scale, we can choose a particular local length scale such that the field $\phi$ no longer appears dynamical, that is, rescale the metric and fields such that $\phi(\text{x}^\mu) = \phi_0$ and "freeze it". The reparametrizations that allow us to do this are :
\[
    g_{\mu \nu}\rightarrow \bigg(\frac{\phi_0}{\phi}\bigg)^2\,g_{\mu \nu},\quad 
    \varphi\rightarrow\frac{\phi}{\phi_0}\,\varphi,\quad 
    B_{\mu}\rightarrow B_{\mu} - \partial_{\mu}\ln(\phi)\ \nonumber
\]
\\
The resulting Lagrangian in the Jordan Frame therefore reads:
\begin{equation}\label{29}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L} &= -\Bigl(\beta\, \varphi^2 + \gamma\, \phi_0\, \varphi + \alpha\, \phi_0^2\Bigr)
\Bigl(R - 6\, B_{\mu} B^{\mu} - 6\, \nabla_{\mu} B^\mu\Bigr) \\
&\quad + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \Bigl(\partial_{\mu}\varphi - \Bigl(\varphi + \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}\,\phi_0\Bigr)B_{\mu}\Bigr)
\Bigl(\partial^{\mu}\varphi - \varphi\,B^{\mu}\Bigr) \\
&\quad - \frac{\mu}{2}\, \phi_0^2\,\varphi^2 
+ \frac{\nu\,\phi_0^2}{2}\,B_{\mu} B^{\mu} 
- \frac{\xi}{16}\,H_{\mu\nu} H^{\mu\nu}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
What we have here is that by gauging away the ``unphysical'' dynamics of the field $\phi$, the gauge field $B_\mu$ has acquired a Proca mass of $\nu \phi_0^2$. This is similar to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism \cite{anderson_plasmons_1963}, \cite{higgs_broken_1964}. In accordance with \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal}, we can send $\nu/\xi \rightarrow \infty$ to give us a Proca field $B_\mu$, (which could be a dark matter candidate \cite{Lasenby_2016}). In this regime, we can neglect the kinetic term corresponding to the Proca field, and it can be eliminated using the EOM as
\begin{equation}\label{30}
B_\mu = \frac{1}{2}\,\partial_\mu \ln\Bigl((\epsilon-12\beta)\,\varphi^2 + (\sigma-12\gamma)\,\phi_0\,\varphi + (\nu-12\alpha)\,\phi_0^2\Bigr)\,.

    and \ref{29} becomes:

    where $V = [(\epsilon - 12\beta) \varphi^2 + (\sigma - 12\gamma) \phi_0 \varphi + (\nu - 12\alpha)\phi^2_0]$. Now, by means of the following conformal transformation 
    \[

    \]
    Wwe can move from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame and separate the Einstein-Hilbert action and the inflaton action. Denoting $M_p/\sqrt{2} = M$, we get:
    \begin{widetext}
    \begin{subequations}\label{33a}
    \begin{align}
    S = \int d^4x\, \sqrt{-g} &\Biggl[- M^2\, R + \,\frac{M^2}{(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)}

Now, employing the following conformal transformation: 
\[
g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow \Omega^2\,g_{\mu\nu},\quad\text{with}\quad \Omega^2 = \frac{M_p^2}{2(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)},
\]
We can move from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame and separate the Einstein-Hilbert action and the inflaton action. Denoting $M_p/\sqrt{2} = M$, the denominator and the numerator of the kinetic term in \ref{42a} by V and N respectively, we get:

\begin{widetext}
    \begin{equation}    \label{33a}
    \begin{aligned}
        S = \int d^4x\, \sqrt{-g} &\Biggl[- M^2\, R + \,\frac{M^2}{(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)}
        \frac{N}{V} (\partial_{\mu}\varphi\,\partial^{\mu}\varphi) \\[2mm]
        &\quad + \frac{3M^2}{2}\,\frac{(2\beta\,\varphi+\gamma\,\phi_0)^2}{(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)^2}\,(\partial_{\mu}\varphi\,\partial^{\mu}\varphi) - \frac{M^4}{(\alpha\,\phi_0^2+\beta\,\varphi^2+\gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi)^2}\,\frac{\mu}{2}\,\phi_0^2\,\varphi^2 \Biggr].
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
\end{widetext}
Denoting $A(\varphi) = (\beta\varphi^2+\gamma\phi_0\varphi+\alpha\phi_0^2)$ and $V(\varphi) = (\epsilon - 12\beta) \varphi^2 + (\sigma - 12\gamma) \phi_0  \varphi + (\nu - 12\alpha)\phi^2_0$. There are 6 free parameters here $\{ \beta, \gamma, \alpha , \epsilon, \sigma, \nu \}$. Using the redundancy in our choice of parameters in \ref{Starting Action}, we can reparametrize the fields $\varphi$ and $\phi_0$ and the parameters to absorb two of these dimensionless parameters. Therefore, we can choose\[
\begin{split}
\text{V} &= \left[(\epsilon - 12\beta)\,\varphi^2 + (\sigma - 12\gamma)\,\phi_0\,\varphi + (\nu - 12\alpha)\,\phi_0^2\right] \\
         &= k\,*\left[\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2\right]
\end{split}
\]
Now only 4 dimensionless parameters remain free; $\{k, \beta, \gamma, \alpha \}$.
\begin{equation} \label{Variable Dictionary}
    \{ \epsilon , \sigma, \nu\} = (12+k) \times \{\beta , \gamma ,\alpha \}    
\end{equation}

    \begin{equation} \label{Variable Dictionary}

\end{equation}
\end{comment}
Discriminant $D = (\sigma -12 \gamma )^2-4 (\nu -12 \alpha ) (\epsilon -12 \beta ) = k^2 (\gamma^2 - 4\alpha \beta) = (\frac{k}{12+k})^2 (\sigma^2 -4 \epsilon \nu)$. This simplifies the equation \ref{33a} and we can write it as:
\begin{widetext}
    \begin{equation} 
    \begin{aligned}
        S &= \int \text{d}^4\text{x} \sqrt{-g} \Bigg[- \frac{M_p^2}{2}R + \frac{1}{2} \left[\ \frac{M_p^2(12+k)(4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2) \phi_0^2}{8(\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2)^2} \right] (\partial_\mu \varphi \partial^\mu \varphi) -  \frac{M_p^4}{4A^2} \bigg( \frac{\mu}{2} \phi^2_0 \varphi^2 \bigg) \Bigg] 
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where we have used $M=M_p/\sqrt{2} $ and $A =\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2$. The first term in the above action \[S = - \frac{M_p^2}{2}\int \text{d}^4\text{x} \sqrt{-g} R\] is just the Einstein-Hilbert action ($S_\text{EH}$) of GR. The remaining part of the action is associated with the inflaton field. It has the form of a non-canonical scalar field, with the kinetic and potential coefficients, $K(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$.

\subsection{Solution} \label{Solution}
We now have all the relevant pieces to analyze the model, given the information in subsection \ref{Non-Canonical Scalar Field Inflation}  and section \ref{Scale Invariant Gravity}. For the starting Lagrangian \ref{Starting Action}, using a neat parameter and field redefinition (which we have done with no loss in generality) given by \ref{Variable Dictionary}, we were able to simplify the action \ref{Starting Action} to one of the form $S_{\text{EH}} + S_{\text{INFLATON}}$. Now, looking at only the inflaton action alone, we have: 
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{INFLATON}} = \int \text{d}^4x \left[ \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \partial_\mu \varphi \partial^\mu \varphi - V(\varphi)\right]
\end{equation}
where, the kinetic and potential terms, $K(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$ are given by:
\begin{align}
    \text{K}(\varphi) &= \left[\ \frac{M_p^2(12+k)(4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2) \phi_0^2}{8(\beta\,\varphi^2 + \gamma\,\phi_0\,\varphi + \alpha\,\phi_0^2)^2} \right] \label{KE} \\
    \text{V}(\varphi) &= M_p^4  \frac{ \kappa \phi_0^4 + 2\omega \phi_0^3 \varphi +\mu \phi^2_0 \varphi^2 + 2\chi \phi_0 \varphi^3 + \lambda \varphi^4 }{8(\beta \varphi^2 + \gamma\phi_0\varphi + \alpha \phi_0^2)^2} \label{VE}
\end{align}
Where, in the final potential formula, we have reinstated $\lambda, \kappa$, $\omega$, and $\chi$.To canonicalize the action, that is, to write it in the form with no kinetic coefficient, we will need to redefine the field such that ($4\alpha \beta > \gamma^2$ has to be satisfied to avoid ghost instabilities):
\begin{equation} \label{40}
    \tilde{\varphi}(\varphi) = \int_0^{\varphi} \sqrt{K(x)} \text{d}x
\end{equation}
Using equation \ref{KE}, we get,
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\varphi}(\varphi) = \sqrt{\frac{12+k}{2}}M_p \arctan \left( \frac{2\varphi\beta + \gamma \phi_0}{\phi_0\sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2}} \right)
\end{equation}
Inverting this relation, we get:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi(\tilde{\varphi}) = \frac{\phi_0}{2\beta} \Biggl[ \sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2} \tan\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}\frac{\tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) - \gamma \Biggr] 
\end{equation}
This redefinition also tells us that the original range $\varphi \in (-\infty,\infty)$ gets mapped to $\tilde{\varphi} \in \left( -\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2},\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$.Therefore using this inside the potential \ref{VE}, we get the potential $V(\varphi(\tilde{\varphi}))$, to get the final canonical inflaton action:
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{INFLATON}} = \int \text{d}^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \tilde{\varphi}\partial^\mu \tilde{\varphi} - V(\varphi(\tilde{\varphi})) \right]
\end{equation}
An immediate consequence is that in the final formula, $\phi_0$ drops out, and we only have the dimensionless parameters to tune. This is interesting as this implies the energy scale at which scale-invariance is broken does not affect the final potential \footnote{This makes sense as we used the gauge redundancy of the action \ref{Starting Action} to make the choice $\phi \rightarrow \phi_0$. However, for any gauge theory, the gauge we choose to work in must not affect the observables of the theory, which is what we see in the potential \ref{Potential}}. We can make this explicit by writing the final potential as:
\begin{align}
    V(X(\tilde{\varphi})) &=  \frac{M_p^4}{8}  \frac{ \kappa + 2\omega X +\mu X^2 + 2\chi X^3 + \lambda X^4 }{(\beta X^2 + \gamma X + \alpha )^2} \label{Potential} \\
    X(\tilde{\varphi}) &= \frac{1}{2\beta} \Biggl[ \sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2} \tan\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}\frac{\tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) - \gamma \Biggr]  \label{X}
\end{align}
Where again we require $\tilde{\varphi} \in \left( -\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2},\sqrt{\frac{12 + k}{2}}M_p \frac{\pi}{2} \right)$. This agrees with many

\subsubsection{Asymptotic Limits} \label{Aymptotic limits}
Analysing this potential, we can see at the limits, $\lim_{X \rightarrow \pm \infty} V(X) \approx \frac{M_p^4}{8} \frac{\lambda}{\beta^2} = V_\infty$. This shows that it plateaus at large $X$ or as $\tilde{\varphi} \rightarrow \frac{\pi}{2 C_k}$, where $C_k = \sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}} \frac{1}{M_p} = \tilde{\varphi}_\text{max}$.

Building on the ideas of references \cite{fairbairn_radion_2003, roest_universality_2014}, which analyzes the two universality classes of single-field inflation, we can attempt to get a rough idea of this model's prediction of $n_s \, \text{vs} \, N$ and $r \, \text{vs} \, N$.
Expanding the potential around the plateau (large $X$ or as $\tilde{\varphi} \rightarrow \tilde{\varphi}_{\text{max}}$):
\begin{equation}
    V(X) \approx \frac{M_p^4}{8} \frac{\lambda}{\beta^2}\left[1 + \frac{B}{X}\right] + \mathcal{O}(X^{-2})
\end{equation}
Where $B = 2(\frac{\chi}{\lambda} - \frac{\gamma}{\beta})$. Denoting $\delta \tilde{\varphi} =  \tilde{\varphi}_{\text{max}} - \tilde{\varphi}$, for small $\delta \tilde{\varphi}$, we get:
\begin{equation}
    \tan(C_k \tilde{\varphi}) \approx \frac{2\beta}{D}X
\end{equation}
Since $\delta \tilde{\varphi} \ll 1$, we get $\tan(C_k \tilde{\varphi}_{\text{max}} - C_k\delta\tilde{\varphi}) = \tan(\frac{\pi}{2} - C_k\delta\tilde{\varphi}) \approx \frac{1}{C_k \delta \tilde{\varphi}}$. Therefore, 
\begin{align} \label{Weird Approx}
    V(\tilde{\varphi}) \approx V_{\infty}[1 - B'(\tilde{\varphi}_{\text{max}} - \tilde{\varphi}) + \cdots]
\end{align}
Where $V_\infty = \frac{M_p^4}{8} \frac{\lambda}{\beta^2}$ and $B' = \frac{4C_k}{D} (\gamma-\frac{\beta\chi}{\lambda})$. Then re-writing equation \ref{Weird Approx} as $V(\delta\tilde{\varphi}) \approx V_{\infty} \exp{[\ln(1 - B'(\delta \tilde{\varphi})]} \approx V_\infty e^{-B'\delta \tilde{\varphi}}$, Expanding the potential around the plateau, taking the asymptotic value to be the background, we get:
\begin{equation}
    V(\tilde{\varphi}) \approx V_\infty [1 - e^{-B' \tilde{\varphi}} ] = M^4 (1 - e^{-q\tilde{\varphi}/M_p})
\end{equation}
In the second equality, we have used compared it to the result from models derived in the context of SUSY \cite{stewart_inflation_1995}, string compactification \cite{cicoli_fibre_2009}, brane inflation \cite{dvali_brane_1999}, and summarized in \cite{martin_encyclopaedia_2014}, using similar analysis, we get:
\begin{align}
    n_s &\approx 1 - \frac{2}{N} \\
    r &\approx \frac{8}{q^2N^2} = \frac{(12+k)(4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2)}{4} \left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda \gamma - \chi \beta} \right)^2 \frac{1}{N^2} 
\end{align}

\begin{comment}
     We can now compare this potential to the well-studied Power-Law inflation models \cite{martin_encyclopaedia_2014} given by:
    \begin{equation}
        V(\tilde{\varphi}) \approx V_\infty e^{-B' \tilde{\varphi}} = M^4 e^{-\alpha' \tilde{\varphi}/M_p}
    \end{equation}
    
    Compared to our model (the $\alpha$ has been primed to distinguish it from the parameter in our model), we get that:
    \begin{align}
        \alpha' &=  \frac{4}{D} \sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}} \left(\gamma - \frac{\beta\chi}{\lambda} \right) \nonumber \\
        n_s &\approx 1 - \alpha^{'2} \, \, \, \, \,\,\,\,\,\,\, r \approx 8 \alpha^{'2} 
    \end{align}
    Though these models are disfavored as they do not depend on the energy scale at which reheating ends, this analysis provide a rough idea of the behaviour at the edges of the graph, where $X$ is large ($\tilde{\varphi} \approx \frac{\pi}{2 C_k}$), that $n_s$ and $r$ become constant. To understand the behaviour in the entire graph requires more careful and exact analysis.
\end{comment}
\subsubsection{Simplification of the model} \label{Reduction of parameters}
We see that roughly, these models exhibit behaviour we would require from such inflationary models. For a more exact analysis, we would have to look at the exact form of the potential \ref{Potential}. This has nine free dimensionless parameters. However, the previous analysis shows us that only certain combinations of parameters affect the observables. To make this exact, we define the new variable $Y$ as:
\begin{align}
    Y(\tilde{\varphi}) &= X(\tilde{\varphi}) + \frac{\gamma}{2\beta}
\end{align}
Denoting $A(X) = \beta X^2 + \gamma X + \alpha$ and $D = \sqrt{4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2}$, we get:
\begin{align}
    A(Y) &= \beta Y^2 + \frac{D^2}{4\beta} \nonumber
\end{align}
For the numerator $N(X) = \kappa + 2\omega X +\mu X^2 + 2\chi X^3 + \lambda X^4$, following a similar procedure as the denominator above, we get the following redefinition of parameters: 
\begin{align}
    \kappa &\rightarrow \kappa - \frac{\gamma\omega}{\beta} + \frac{\gamma^2\mu}{4\beta^2} - \frac{\gamma^3\chi}{4\beta^3} +\frac{\gamma^4\lambda}{16\beta^4}    \nonumber \\
    2\omega &\rightarrow 2\omega - \frac{\gamma\mu}{\beta} + \frac{3\gamma^2\chi}{2\beta^2} - \frac{\gamma^3\lambda}{2\beta^3}   \nonumber \\
    \mu &\rightarrow \mu - \frac{3\gamma\chi}{\beta} + \frac{3\gamma^2\lambda}{2\beta^2} \nonumber \\
    2\chi &\rightarrow 2\chi - \frac{2\gamma\lambda}{\beta} \nonumber \\
    \lambda &\rightarrow \lambda \label{huge redefiniton}
\end{align}
Using this redefinition of parameters, we can write the numerator as before, however, with $Y$ as the primary variable $N(Y) = \kappa + 2\omega Y +\mu Y^2 + 2\chi Y^3 + \lambda Y^4$. Writing down the equations \ref{Potential} and \ref{X}, we see
\begin{align}
    V(Y) &= \frac{M_p^4}{8} \left(\frac{\lambda Y^4 + 2 \chi Y^3 + \mu Y^2  + 2\omega Y + \kappa}{(Y^2 + D^2)^2} \right) \nonumber \\
    Y(\tilde{\varphi}) &= D \tan \left(\frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p} \right) \nonumber
\end{align}
Where, we have performed another implicit redefiniton as $D \rightarrow \frac{D}{2\beta}$, $ \{\lambda, 2\chi, \mu, 2\omega,  \kappa \} \rightarrow \{\lambda, 2\chi, \mu, 2\omega,  \kappa \} /\beta^2$ and denoted $\sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}} = C$. As a last step, we see that a factor of $D^4$ can be factored from both the numerator and denominator provided we make the identification $\{Y, \lambda, \chi, \mu, \omega, \kappa \} \rightarrow \{Y/D, \lambda, \chi/D, \mu/D^2, \omega/D^3, \kappa/D^4 \}$ to get:
\begin{align}
    V(Y) &=  \frac{M_p^4}{8}  \left(\frac{\lambda Y^4 + 2 \chi Y^3 + \mu Y^2  + 2\omega Y + \kappa}{(Y^2 + 1)^2} \right) \label{finalest potential} \\
    Y(\tilde{\varphi}) &=  \tan \left(\frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p} \right) \label{finalest redef}
\end{align}
Therefore, starting from the equations \ref{Potential} and \ref{X} with nine parameters, we were able to reduce our model to one with only 6 as shown in \ref{finalest potential} and \ref{finalest redef}. $\{\alpha, \gamma,\beta, k , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa\} \rightarrow \{C , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa\}$. The original conditions on the parameters and variables get inherited by this new set as $\tilde{\varphi} \in (-\frac{\pi M_p}{2C},\frac{\pi M_p}{2C})$, $Y \in (-\infty,\infty)$ and $C > 0$. We can simplify the potential \ref{finalest potential} and write it directly as a function of $\tilde{\varphi}$ as:

\begin{widetext}
    \begin{equation} 
    \begin{aligned} \label{Ugliest full Potential}
        V(\tilde{\varphi}) =  \frac{M_p^4}{8} \Bigg(\lambda \sin^4\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) + 2 \chi \sin^3\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) \cos\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right)  + \mu \sin^2\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) \cos^2\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) + 2\omega \sin\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) \cos^3\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right)  \\ + \kappa \cos^4\left( \frac{C \tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) \Bigg)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
The only assumption in this process was that $\beta \neq 0$, which is required for $D > 0$. The mapping of these new dimensionless parameters at the end in equation \ref{Ugliest full Potential} to the original ones we started with in equation \ref{Potential} has been given in the Appendix \ref{Mapping of Parameters}. Denoting $\frac{C\tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}$ as $\theta$, the first and second derivatives of this potential are given by:
\begin{widetext}
    \begin{equation} 
    \begin{aligned} \label{Derivatives of Pot}
    \frac{\text{d}V}{\text{d}\tilde{\varphi}} &= \frac{CM_P^3}{8} \left[ (-\chi + \omega) \cos4\theta + (-\kappa + \lambda) \sin2\theta + \cos2\theta (\chi + \omega - (\kappa + \lambda - \mu ) 
    \sin2\theta) \right] \nonumber \\
    \frac{\text{d}^2V}{\text{d}\tilde{\varphi}^2} &= -\frac{C^2M_P^2}{4} \left[ (\kappa - \lambda) \cos2\theta + (\kappa + \lambda - \mu) \cos4\theta + (\chi+\omega) \sin2\theta + 2(-\chi + \omega) \sin4\theta \right]  \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
To analyse the the effective mass of the inflaton, we shall make the simplifying assumption that the minimum of the potential occurs at zero (i.e., $V_{,\tilde{\varphi}} = 0$, this is not a general analysis and is a particular regime of solutions we are choosing to focus on) for that, we require $\omega = 0$.
Using this in the formula for the second derivative, we get:
\begin{equation}
    m_{\tilde{\varphi}}^2 \approx  \frac{\text{d}^2V}{\text{d}\tilde{\varphi}^2} \Bigg|_0 = \frac{C^2M_p^2}{4}(  \mu + \lambda - 2\kappa)
\end{equation}
\textbf{CHECK}
This result is exact for the given potential if we set $\omega = 0$. Again, by mass, we refer to the coefficient of the quadratic term in the potential (See footnote \ref{Footnote 1}). We require $m_{\tilde{\varphi}}^2 > 0$ to allow for reheating, as this corresponds to $V_{,\tilde{\varphi}\tilde{\varphi}} > 0$; a minimum around which the inflaton field can oscillate.

\begin{comment}
    This last redefiniton and form of the potential \ref{final potential} and \ref{final redefiniton} essentially help us reduce our parameter list further by two $\{\alpha, \gamma,\beta, k , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa\} \rightarrow \{D, C , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa\}$. The original conditions on the parameters and variables get inherited to this new set as $Y \in (-\infty,\infty)$ and $D,C > 0$
    
    We have therefore reduced our parameter list by one $[\alpha, \gamma,\beta, k , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa] \rightarrow [D, \beta , k , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa]$

    
    Denoting $A(X) = \beta X^2 + \gamma X + \alpha$, $N(X) = \kappa + 2\omega X +\mu X^2 + 2\chi X^3 + \lambda X^4$ and $D = \sqrt{4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2}$, we get that the slow roll parameter $\epsilon_V$ is:
    \begin{align}
        \epsilon_V(\tilde{\varphi}) &= \frac{2 M_p^2}{C_k^2 D^2} \left[ \frac{N'(X)}{N(X)} - \frac{A'(X)}{A(X)} \right]^2 
    \end{align} 
\end{comment}



\begin{comment}
    \epsilon_V &= \frac{4M_p^4}{(12+k)(4\alpha\beta-\gamma^2)} \left[ \frac{2\omega + 2\mu X + 6\chi X^2 + 4\lambda X^3}{\kappa + 2\omega X +\mu X^2 + 2\chi X^3 + \lambda X^4 } - \frac{2 \beta X + \gamma}{\beta X^2 + \gamma X + \alpha} \right]^2
    


    $\text{params} = [\alpha, \gamma,\beta, \epsilon, \sigma, \nu , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa]$
    After the variable parameterization, now only 4 dimensionless parameters still remain free; $\{\alpha, \gamma,\beta, \epsilon, \sigma , \nu\} \rightarrow \{k, \beta, \gamma, \alpha \}$.
    So now $\text{params} = [\alpha, \gamma,\beta, k , \mu, \omega, \chi, \lambda, \kappa]$
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{Bmatrix}
            \epsilon \\ \sigma \\ \nu 
        \end{Bmatrix}
        = (12+k)
        \begin{Bmatrix}
            \beta \\ \gamma \\ \alpha
        \end{Bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{align}
        V({\tilde{\varphi}}) &= M^4  \frac{ \kappa \phi_0^4 + 2\omega \phi_0^3 \tilde{\varphi} +\mu^2 \phi^2_0 \tilde{\varphi}^2 + 2\chi \phi_0 \tilde{\varphi}^3 + \lambda \tilde{\varphi}^4 }{2(\beta \tilde{\varphi}^2 + \gamma\phi_0\tilde{\varphi} + \alpha \phi_0^2)^2} \nonumber \\
        \varphi(\tilde{\varphi}) &= \frac{\phi_0}{2\beta} \Biggl[ \sqrt{4\alpha\beta - \gamma^2} \tan\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}\frac{\tilde{\varphi}}{M_p}\right) - \gamma \Biggr] 
    \end{align}

\appendix

\section{Translating variables from Salvio to Barker} \label{Appendix A}
In the paper \cite{Salvio_2022}, the authors derived an inflaton potential using metric-affine gravity. The motivation here is to give inflation a geometrical explanation. 
By starting with this action, 
\begin{equation}
    S = \int \text{d}^4\text{x} \sqrt{-g} (\alpha \mathcal{R} + \beta \mathcal{R}' + c' \mathcal{R}'^{2})
\end{equation}
Where $\mathcal{R}'$ is the Holst Invariant, a \textit{scale-invariant} quantity. The potential derived finally is: 
\begin{equation}
    U_S(\omega) = \frac{1}{4 c'} \left[ \frac{M_{p}^{2}}{4} \text{sinh}(\text{X}(\omega)) - \beta  \right]^2
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \text{X}_S(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{\omega}{M_{p}} + \text{tanh}^{-1} \left(\frac{4 \beta}{\sqrt{M_{p}^{4}+16 \beta^2}} \right)
\end{equation}
Barker \cite{barker2024poincaregaugetheoryconformal} derives a similar form of the potential starting with a scale-invariant scalar field. The resulting potential there is:
\begin{equation}
    U_B(\varphi) = \frac{\mu^2 \phi_{0}^{4}}{2} \left[ \frac{\sigma}{2} + \sqrt{\nu - \frac{\sigma^2}{4}} \text{sinh}\left( \text{X}'(\varphi) \right)  \right]^2
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \text{X}_B(\varphi) =  \frac{\varphi}{\phi_0 \sqrt{\nu - \frac{\sigma^2}{4}}} - \frac{c}{\phi_0 \sqrt{\nu - \frac{\sigma^2}{4}}}
\end{equation}
The substitutions necessary to transform back and forth from these models are: 
\begin{align}
    \phi_0 &= g \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} M_p  \nonumber \\
    \mu &= g^{-1} \frac{1}{6 \sqrt{2 c'}}  \nonumber \\
    \sigma &= - g^{-1} \frac{8 \beta}{M_{p}^{2}}  \nonumber \\
    \nu &= g^{-2} \left( 1 + \frac{16 \beta^2}{M_{p}^{4}} \right) \nonumber \\
    c  &= -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} M_{p} \text{tanh}^{-1} \left(\frac{4 \beta}{\sqrt{M_{p}^{4}+16 \beta^2}} \right)
\end{align}

where $g$ is a dimensionless parameter, this tells us that the Barker model has an extra redundant parameter that we can absorb into the definitions of the other variables.
\section{Non-Canonical Scalar Field Inflation} \label{Non-Canonical Scalar Field Inflation}

A good part of this project was spent analysing a non-canonical scalar field. To do so, machinery distinct from the one displayed in section \ref{Canonical Scalar Field Inflation} was required. The following is the derivation for the same. Some of the equations derived have not been found elsewhere in literature (like the EOM for $\varphi$ as a function of N)
\begin{equation} \label{13}
    S = \int \text{dt}\text{d}^3\text{x} \; \text{a}^3(t) \left[ \frac{K(\varphi)}{2}\dot{\varphi}^2 - V(\varphi) \right]
\end{equation}
We vary the action and upon integrating by parts we get,
\begin{equation}
    \delta S = - \int \text{dt}\,\text{d}^3\textbf{x} \; \left[ a^3 K \ddot{\varphi} + a^3K_{,\varphi} \frac{\dot{\varphi}^2}{2}  +  3\dot{a} a^2 K \dot{\varphi} + a^3V_{,\varphi}  \right]\delta \varphi
\end{equation}
Setting this variation to zero, we get the equation of motion for a non-canonical scalar field.
\begin{equation} \label{16}
    K \ddot{\varphi} + \dot{\varphi} \left(\frac{K_{,\varphi} \dot{\varphi}}{2} + 3H K \right) + V_{,\varphi}   = 0
\end{equation}
We see this aligns with the canonical scalar field when we set $K = 1$, getting equation \ref{KGEOM}. To derive the EOM of the inflaton field with respect to the e-folding time ($N = \int H \text{d}t$). we use the energy density and the pressure of the fluid, which are as follows: 
\begin{align}   \label{18}
    \rho &= \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 + V(\varphi) \nonumber \\
    p &= \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 - V(\varphi)
\end{align}
Using the third Friedmann equation \ref{Friedmann Eqn 2}, we get:
\begin{equation}    \label{19}
    3 M_p^2H^2 = \frac{K(\varphi)}{2} \dot{\varphi}^2 + V(\varphi)
\end{equation}
Upon differentiating this expression with respect to time and using \ref{16}, we get:
\begin{equation} \label{20}
    2 M_p^2 \dot{H} = -  K \dot{\varphi}^2
\end{equation}
Now that we have all the relevant parameters as functions of the field, we can look at equation \ref{16} and replace the time derivative there with the derivative with respect to the e-folding time N. Using $\text{d}N = H \text{d}t$, we get our final answer of the field evolution as a differential equation with respect to N. (Setting $K = 1$ in the below equation also gives us equation \ref{phi vs N})
\begin{widetext}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{Kphi vs N}
    K\frac{\text{d}^2\varphi}{\text{d}N^2} +3 K \frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N}  - \frac{K^2}{2M_p^2} \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^3  +  \frac{K_{,\varphi}}{2}  \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^2 +  \left( 3 M_p^2 - \frac{K}{2} \left(\frac{\text{d}\varphi}{\text{d}N} \right)^2 \right) \frac{\text{d}\ln \text{V}(\varphi)}{\text{d} \varphi} = 0    
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{widetext}
\subsubsection{Slow Roll Inflation for noncanonical scalar field}
The acceleration equation for a universe dominated by the inflaton field with the energy density $\rho_{\varphi}$ and pressure $p_{\varphi}$, as defined in \ref{18} is given by the Friedmann equation \ref{Friedmann Eqn 1},
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} (\rho +3p) = -\frac{8\pi G}{3} (K(\varphi){\dot{\varphi}}^2 - V(\varphi)) 
\end{equation}
Using similar techniques as Section \ref{Slow Roll Inflation}, we get the Hamilton-Jacobi equation as: 
\begin{equation}    \label{KHJ}
    H'^2 - \frac{3K(\varphi)}{2M_p^2}H^2 = - \frac{K(\varphi) V(\varphi)}{2M_p^4} 
\end{equation}
The slow roll parameters therefore are:
\begin{align}
    \epsilon_H &= - M_p^2 \left(\frac{\dot{H}}{H} \right) = \frac{M_p^2}{2 K(\varphi)} \left(\frac{V,_\varphi}{V}\right)^2 \\
    \eta_V &= \frac{M_p^2}{K(\varphi)} \left( \frac{V_{,,\varphi}}{V} \right)^2 - \frac{M_p^2}{2} \frac{K_{,\varphi}}{K^2} \frac{V_{,\varphi}}{V}
\end{align}


\section{3+1 decomposition of spacetime} \label{3+1 decomposition of spacetime}
In general relativity, spacetime is modeled as a four-dimensional manifold equipped with a Lorentzian metric, where space and time are fundamentally intertwined. However, for many physical and cosmological problems, it is both natural and advantageous to disentangle space and time. Given that the FLRW metric supposes spatial homogeneity and isotropy, a natural choice to analyse the metric and dynamics of this spacetime would be to slice the 4D spacetime $\mathcal{M}_4$ into a time-ordered sequence of 3D spacelike hypersurfaces $\Sigma_t$ such that on each hypersurface, time is constant \cite{baumann2012tasilecturesinflation}, 
\cite{gourgoulhon_31_2007}. By considering such a family of non-intersecting hypersurfaces, we can recast Einstein's equations and a general action like the one written down in equation \ref{Start of derivation} into a form that treats time evolution as a dynamical process. This approach underpins both the initial value (Cauchy) formulation of general relativity and modern numerical relativity, and it provides a direct connection to the Newtonian intuition of evolving initial data forward in time \cite{choquet-bruhat_global_1969}. The spatial hypersurfaces $\Sigma_t$ and the splitting is defined as such:
\begin{equation}
    \forall t \in \mathbb{R} : \Sigma_t = \{p \in \mathcal{M}_4 \, | \, \hat{t} (p) = t\} \nonumber
\end{equation}
Since $t$ (time) is always increasing and we want this slicing to cover all of spacetime, we require:
\begin{align}
    \Sigma_t \cap \Sigma_{t'} &= \emptyset \,\, \text{for}\,\, t \neq t' \nonumber \\
    \mathcal{M}_4 &= \bigcup_{t \in \mathbb{R}} \Sigma_t \nonumber
\end{align}
This allows us to to decompose the 4D manifold into a non-intersecting family of spacelike hypersurfaces such that $\mathcal{M}_4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \times \Sigma$, where $t \in \mathbb{R}$. On each hypersurface $\Sigma_t$, one can introduce a coordinate system $(x^i) = (x^1,x^2,x^3)$. For a well-behaved coordinate system on $\mathcal{M}_4$, we will require that this coordinate system varies smoothly between neighbouring hypersurfaces. Given a spacelike $\Sigma_t$, we can naturally define a unit normal 1-form 
\begin{equation} \label{unit 1-form}
    \underline{\bm{n}} =  \alpha \textbf{d}t    
\end{equation}
(Standard literature on this material uses N to denote the proportionality constant between the gradient 1-form and the 1-form $\underline{\bm{n}}$, but since we are going to be using $N$ for the efolding time, we will use $\alpha$ to avoid confusion). Using the full metric, we can also define a vector in $\mathcal{T_p}(\mathcal{M}_4)$ denoted by $\bm{n}$.

By looking at the orthogonal projection operator $\Vec{\mathbf{\gamma}} : \mathcal{T_p}(\mathcal{M}_4) \rightarrow \mathcal{T_p}(\Sigma_t)$, we can define an extended induced metric $\gamma_{\alpha\beta} = g_{\alpha\beta} + n_\alpha n_\beta$ (since $g^{\mu\nu} n_\mu n_\nu = 1$, we can define the inverse metric $\gamma^{\alpha\beta} = g^{\alpha\beta} + n^\alpha n^\beta$). This defines an induced metric on $\Sigma_t$, ensuring that vectors normal to the surface give a zero dot product and tangential vectors maintain the same dot product structure inherited from the full manifold. 

Choosing the natural basis of $\mathcal{T}_p(\mathcal{M}_4)$ associated with the coordinates $(x^\alpha) =(t,x^i)$ as $(\bm{\partial}_\alpha)=(\bm{\partial}_t, \bm{\partial}_i)$. Given that this is dual to the 1-form basis $(\textbf{d}x^\alpha) = (\textbf{d}t, \textbf{d}x^i)$, we have $\langle \textbf{d}t, \bm{\partial}_t \rangle = 1$, so given equation \ref{unit 1-form}, we get $\bm{\partial}_t = \alpha \bm{n} + \bm{\beta}$, where the vector $\bm{\beta}$ is the ``shift'' vector tangent to the hypersurface ($\bm{\beta} = \beta^i \boldsymbol{\partial}_i$). 

Now using the components of the 3-metric $\gamma_{i j}$ with respect to the coordinates $(x^i)$, we can write $\beta_i = \gamma_{ij}\beta^j$. The components of the metric $\bm{g}$ with respect to the coordinates $(x^\alpha)$ therefore are $\bm{g} \equiv g_{\alpha \beta} \textbf{d}x^\alpha \otimes \textbf{d}x^\beta$
By this definition, we see that we can extract the components of the metric by looking at it's action on the basis of the vector space. 
\begin{equation}
    g_{\alpha\beta} = \bm{g} (\bm{\partial}_\alpha, \bm{\partial}_\beta)
\end{equation}
This gives upon substitution of the $\bm{\partial}_t = \alpha \bm{n} + \bm{\beta}$:
\begin{equation} \label{General split Metric}
    g_{\mu \nu} \text{d}x^\mu\text{d}x^\nu = \alpha^2 \text{d}t^2 - \gamma_{ij}(\text{d}x^i + \beta^i \text{d}t)(\text{d}x^j + \beta^j \text{d}t)
\end{equation}
The vector $\alpha \bm{n}$ defines a vector field on $\mathcal{M}_4$, $\bm{t}$, normal to $\Sigma_t$, such that under its flow, points on $\Sigma_t$ flow to the neighbouring hypersurface $\Sigma_{t+\delta t}$. The shift vector $\bm{\beta}$ defines how coordinates ``shift'' from neighbouring spacelike hypersurfaces on the plane (tangent to $\Sigma_t$). 

\begin{comment}
    So far, the discussion has been quite general; however, coming to the FLRW metric, which is spatially homogeneous and isotropic, we shall set $\beta^i = 0$. Giving us $g_{\mu \nu} \text{d}x^\mu\text{d}x^\nu = \alpha^2 \text{d}t^2 - \gamma_{ij}\text{d}x^i\text{d}x^j$ (The EOM we get through $\beta^i$ give us momentum conservation),
\end{comment}

The spatial slices $\Sigma_t$, homogeneous and isotropic 3-spaces, have constant 3-curvature. We can therefore choose one of three embeddings such that the curvature is either negative, zero, or positive. 

We can also define the intrinsic Ricci Scalar (${}^{(3)}R$) of the spatial hypersurface $\Sigma_t$ using the induced metric $\gamma_{ij}$. This metric naturally has it's own connection ${}^{(3)}\Gamma_{ij}^k$ and Riemman Tensor ${}^{(3)}R_{ijl}^k$ defined in the usual way. Contracting this twice gives us the 3-Ricci scalar:
\begin{equation}
    {}^{(3)}R = \gamma^{ij} \,{}^{(3)}R_{ij}
\end{equation}

\section{Mapping of Parameters} \label{Mapping of Parameters}
In equation \ref{Ugliest full Potential}, we have the parameters ($p_f = \{C,\lambda, 2\chi, \mu, 2\omega,  \kappa \}$) (Which shall be denoted with an underscore f), which we got from algebraic manipulations of the parameters in equation \ref{Potential} ($p = \{\beta,\gamma,\alpha,\lambda, k, 2\chi, \mu, 2\omega,  \kappa \}$) (Which shall be denoted as is). The mapping from $p_f \rightarrow p$ is given by (where $D = \sqrt{4\alpha \beta- \gamma^2}$):

\begin{align}
    \kappa_f &= \frac{16\beta^2}{D^4}\Big(\kappa - \frac{\gamma\omega}{\beta} + \frac{\gamma^2\mu}{4\beta^2} - \frac{\gamma^3\chi}{4\beta^3} +\frac{\gamma^4\lambda}{16\beta^4} \Big)   \nonumber \\
    2\omega_f &= \frac{8\beta}{D^3} \Big(2\omega - \frac{\gamma\mu}{\beta} + \frac{3\gamma^2\chi}{2\beta^2} - \frac{\gamma^3\lambda}{2\beta^3}\Big)   \nonumber \\
    \mu_f &= \frac{4}{D^2} \Big(\mu - \frac{3\gamma\chi}{\beta} + \frac{3\gamma^2\lambda}{2\beta^2} \Big) \nonumber \\
    2\chi_f &= \frac{2}{D\beta} \Big(2\chi - \frac{2\gamma\lambda}{\beta}\Big) \nonumber \\
    \lambda_f &= \frac{1}{\beta^2}\lambda \nonumber \\
    C &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{12+k}}
\end{align}
Since this mapping is many-to-one, it shows that there is a redundancy in the parameters used in \ref{Starting Action}, \ref{Potential}, as they still result in the same final potential \ref{Ugliest full Potential} without any loss in generality or physics.
