Dear Prabhoda,

How have things gone so far this weekend? I'm in Catania now, but I should have
wifi from this evening. I've pushed to `master` a slightly improved version of
the posterior plot for you to use. The names of the chains should be clear in
the script, so you can hunt for these in your full-grid download.

Hopefully the comments in the script are self-explanatory. Don't forget to
beautify the plot as much as you can, including the use of TeX-style labels
using `rc`.

Best -w
